# Prompts

Prompts are the instructions you give to the AI to generate content. AI Assistant includes built-in prompts and allows you to create custom prompts.

## Built-in Prompts

AI Assistant comes with several built-in prompts for common content generation tasks. These prompts are ready to use and can be customized.

## Custom Prompts

1. Go to **AI Assistant → Prompts**
2. Click **New Prompt**
3. Enter a name and prompt text
4. Optionally bind the prompt to a specific integration
5. Set sort order
6. Save

## Prompt Binding

You can bind a prompt to a specific integration. When a prompt is bound to an integration:

- That integration will be used automatically when the prompt is selected
- The prompt will only appear when that integration is enabled

## Sort Order

Prompts can be ordered to appear in your preferred sequence. Set a sort order value (lower numbers appear first) to organize your prompts.
