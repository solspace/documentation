# Translating

## Static Translations

To make a translation, follow Craft's instructions for [Translating Static Text](https://craftcms.com/docs/5.x/system/sites.html#static-message-translations). Then continue with this AI Assistant-specific guide.

### Control Panel

To translate the AI Assistant control panel, you can simply:

1. Duplicate the `ai-assistant.php` file inside the AI Assistant plugin located at the `./vendor/solspace/craft-aiassistant/src/translations/en` folder.
2. Then move it into the language ID folder (e.g. `de`) of your Craft `./translations/` directory.
    - If the `translations` directory does not yet exist, you'll need to create it (e.g. `./translations/de/aiassistant.php`).
3. Then update those language keys inside your new AI Assistant translation file.
