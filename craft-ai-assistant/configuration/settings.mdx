# Settings

AI Assistant settings allow you to configure which fields show the inline AI button and set up field-specific prompts.

## Field Enablement

1. Go to **AI Assistant → Settings**
2. Toggle which fields show the inline AI button
3. Save

## Field-Specific Prompts

You can preselect a prompt for each enabled field so the Generate modal opens with the right context:

1. Go to **AI Assistant → Settings**
2. In the "Field Prompts" table, choose a prompt per field (or keep "Any")
3. Save Settings

### Behavior on Entry Edit Pages

- When you click the inline AI button, the modal will auto-select the field's prompt.
- This works for Craft fields (Plain Text, CKEditor, Redactor, TinyMCE, Assets) and for the built-in Title field (handle `title`).
- For Title specifically, the modal reads the selection from plugin settings, so it's honored even though Title isn't a custom Craft field.

### Notes

- Choosing "Any" means the modal won't preselect a specific prompt.
- If a prompt is bound to a particular integration, that integration is used automatically; otherwise the selected integration is used.
- Changes you make to the selected prompt inside an entry are not saved back to Settings; edit the mapping in **AI Assistant → Settings**.
