# Installing & Updating

## Requirements

Solspace Calendar 3.x is compatible with EE4 and EE5 with mostly the same minimum requirements as listed on the [ExpressionEngine Requirements](https://docs.expressionengine.com/latest/installation/requirements.html) page:

- **ExpressionEngine 4.x - 5.x**
- PHP 7 or newer
- MySQL 5.6 or newer
- Windows and macOS browsers:
  - Chrome 21 or newer
  - Firefox 28 or newer
  - Safari 9.0 or newer
  - Internet Explorer 11 or newer
  - Microsoft Edge

## Installing Instructions

1. Unzip the download package:
   - Select the EE version you're installing Calendar for (**ee4** for EE 4.x/5.x or **ee3** for EE 3.x).
   - Within that EE version directory, copy the _calendar_ folder into your sites **./system/user/addons/** directory.
   - Within the **themes** folder of that EE version directory, copy the _calendar_ folder into your site's **./themes/user/** directory.
2. Go to the _Add-Ons_ area (under **Developer** navigation tab), scroll to down to the **Third Party Add-Ons** section, and find _Calendar_ in the list, and click **Install**.
3. Setup and configuring:
   - Before you start using Calendar, you’ll need to create Calendar field(s), calendars, and set some preferences in the _Preferences_ area of the [Control Panel](../guides/control-panel.mdx).
   - If you wish to install the demo templates, click on the _Demo Templates_ navigation item inside the [Control Panel](../guides/control-panel.mdx) area.

:::info
If you had a previous non-Calendar flow setup where you used regular EE fields acting as Start/End Dates and Start/End Times and you're slowly transitioning from that to Calendar, please be sure that any of fields these are not named something like: `event_start_date`, `event_start_time`, `event_end_date`, `event_end_time`, etc. These are reserved names for Calendar's use, and will cause errors like `DateTime::__construct(): Failed to parse time string (0) at position 0 (0): Unexpected character` in your templates if you do not rename or remove the other fields.
:::

## Updating Instructions

:::info
If you're **upgrading from Calendar 1.x** on ExpressionEngine 2.x, it's recommended that you upload the new Calendar files to your new ExpressionEngine 3.x site directory just before running the EE2 -> EE3 upgrade. Please see [Calendar 1.x to 2.x Upgrade Guide](../migrations/calendar-1-migration.mdx) before considering upgrading.
:::

Calendar has its own **Update Service** built in, which means that every time there's an update available, an **Updates Available** nav item will show up in the Calendar add-on area of the EE control panel. You can then review the changelog there, or [view it here](./changelog.mdx).
