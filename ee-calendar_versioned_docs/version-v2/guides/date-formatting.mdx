# Date Formatting

In addition to standard [EE date formatting](https://docs.expressionengine.com/v7/templates/date-variable-formatting.html), Calendar supports easy-to-use text format versions of dates for all parameters that accept date values. Text dates are relative to today. So for example, you can specify dates like this:

- **today**
- **tomorrow**
- **yesterday**
- **X day(s)** (where **X** is a number of days greater than or equal to 1)
- **X week(s)** (where **X** is a number of weeks greater than or equal to 1)
- **X month(s)** (where **X** is a number of months greater than or equal to 1)
- **X year(s)** (where **X** is a number of years greater than or equal to 1)
- The word **ago** can also be appended to refer to dates in the past. For example, **1 week** means one week from today, while **1 week ago** means one week ago.

To display all events that fall within today's date, up to 3 months in the future, you can do something like this:

```html showLineNumbers
date_range_start="today" date_range_end="3 months"
```

Regular date syntax is also available:

- **YYYYMMDD**
- **YYYY-MM-DD**
- **year-month-day** (where **year** is current year, **month** is current month and **day** is current day)

When using either **YYYY-MM-DD**, you may replace one or more of the numeric values with the literal words _year_, _month_, and/or _day_. Calendar will then replace that word with the relevant value for the current date. Examples:

- _year-12-25_ = Christmas Day in the current year.
- _2015-month-15_ = The fifteenth day of the current month in 2015.

The literal value _year-month-day_ is equivalent to “today”. You may also use the word “**last**” instead of “**day**”. Doing so will set the date to the final day of the relevant month. Examples:

- _2015-02-last_ = February 28, 2015
- _2016-02-last_ = February 29, 2016
- _year-month-last_ = The last day of the current month of the current year.
