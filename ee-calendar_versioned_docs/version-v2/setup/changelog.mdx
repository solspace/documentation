## 2.0.0<TitleDate date="2016-02-15" />

### Added
- Added support for [EE Multiple Site Manager](https://docs.expressionengine.com/v3/msm/index.html) (MSM).
- Added [Low Events 1.5+ migration](../migrations/low-events-migration.mdx) path.

### Changed
- Updated Calendar to be compatible with ExpressionEngine 3+ (only). Calendar 1.x is required for ExpressionEngine 2.x.
- Completely rewrote Calendar from the ground up. Added [migration utility for Calendar 1.x](../migrations/calendar-1-migration.mdx) users to upgrade.
- [Calendar field is now a full fieldtype](../guides/fieldtype.mdx) that can be used in any channel and as many times as you wish.
- Updated [Calendar:Events](../templating/events.mdx) template tag to show a chronological list of all recurrences (like Calendar:Cal in Calendar 1.x used to behave). To achieve old Calendar:Events tag (in Calendar 1.x) behavior, simply use the [Calendar fieldtype variable pair and variables inside of a Channel:Entries tag](../templating/channel-entries.mdx), or for lists specify the [show_recurrences="no" parameter in Calendar:Events](../templating/events.mdx#show_recurrences) tag.
- Renamed Calendar:iCalendar template tag to [Calendar:ICS_Export](../templating/ics-export.mdx).

### Removed
- Removed ability to create additional occurrence rules.
- Removed ability to make one-off occurrence manipulations (sometimes referred to as Custom Edited Occurrences in Calendar 1.x).
- Removed ability to import Calendar data with ICS. -05 should be added back in a future release.
- Removed Calendar:ICS_Update template tag, as ICS import is currently not available.
- Removed Calendar:Year_List template tag.
- Removed Calendar:Mini calendar template tag, as this can be achieved with [Calendar:Month](../templating/month.mdx) tag.
- Removed Calendar:Occurrences template tag loop in favor of [\{calendar:recurrences} variable pair](../templating/channel-entries.mdx#calendar_recurrences).
- Removed Calendar:Cal template tag in favor of [Calendar:Events](../templating/events.mdx) and using the functionality broken down into [Calendar:Month](../templating/month.mdx), [Calendar:Week](../templating/week.mdx), and [Calendar:Day](../templating/day.mdx) template tags. Removed the hidden auto-formatting functionality from these template tags as well.
- Removed `{rules}{/rules}` variable pair and variables from Calendar:Events template tag.
- Removed ability to repeat events forever (must have a specified end date).
- Removed `show_RANGE=""` parameters. This is generally already available with the easy-to-use text date formatting options for [`date_range_end=""` parameter](../templating/events.mdx#date_range_end).
- Removed ability to filter event results by time (full days allowed only now).
- Removed per calendar time formatting controls.
- Removed timezone settings and localization.
