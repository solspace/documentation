# Installing & Updating

## Requirements

Solspace Calendar 1.x is compatible with EE2 with mostly the same minimum requirements as listed on the [ExpressionEngine Requirements](https://docs.expressionengine.com/v2/installation/requirements.html) page:

- **ExpressionEngine 2.10.x+**
- PHP 5.3.10 or newer
- MySQL 5.0.3 or newer
- Windows and macOS browsers:
  - Chrome 19 or newer
  - Firefox 13 or newer
  - Safari 5.1 or newer
  - Internet Explorer 8 or newer

## Installing Instructions

1. Unzip the download package:
   - Within the `/system/expressionengine/third_party/` directory, copy the **calendar** folder into your site's `./system/expressionengine/third_party/` directory.
   - Within the `/themes/third_party/` directory, copy the `calendar` folder into your site's `./themes/third_party/` directory.
2. Go to the _Modules_ area in the ExpressionEngine control panel, find _Calendar_ in the list, and click **Install**.

- Upon installation, Calendar creates two new channels (**Calendar: Calendars** and **Calendar: Events**) as well as two new custom channel field groups (**Calendar: Calendars** and **Calendar: Events**) with a few sample fields. These channels and field groups are tied in together with Calendar.

3. Setup and configuring:
   - To create your first calendar, select the **Calendar: Calendars** channel from the Publish tab in the ExpressionEngine control panel. Each calendar is actually just a glorified channel entry. You can add more this way, or edit existing ones as usual.
   - To create your first event, select the **Calendar: Events** channel from the Publish tab in the ExpressionEngine control panel. Each event is actually just a glorified channel entry that is related to a Calendar channel entry.
   - To adjust any settings in Calendar, click on the **Preferences** tab in the [Control Panel](../guides/control-panel.mdx) area and then modify as necessary.
   - If you wish to install the demo templates, click on the **Demo Templates** tab inside the [Control Panel](../guides/control-panel.mdx) area.

## Updating Instructions

1. Within your EE site's `./system/expressionengine/third_party/` and `./themes/third_party/` directories, delete the **calendar** folders.
2. Unzip the download package:

- Within the `/system/expressionengine/third_party/` directory, copy the **calendar** folder into your site's `./system/expressionengine/third_party/` directory.
- Within the `/themes/third_party/` directory, copy the `calendar` folder into your site's `./themes/third_party/` directory.

3. Go to the _Modules_ area in the ExpressionEngine control panel and click the **Run Module Updates** button.
