  - Safari 9.0 or newer
  - Internet Explorer 11 or newer
  - Microsoft Edge

## Installing Instructions

1. Unzip the download package:
   - Select the EE version you're installing Freeform for (e.g. **EE6-7** for EE 6.x or EE 7.x).
   - Within that EE version directory, copy the _freeform_next_ folder to your EE site's **./system/user/addons/** directory.
   - Within the **themes** folder of that EE version directory, copy the _freeform_next_ folder to your EE site's **./themes/user/** directory.
2. Go to the _Add-Ons_ page and find _Freeform_ in the list, and click **Install**.

## Updating Instructions

:::info
If you're switching from Freeform Classic to the new Freeform, please see the [Switching from Freeform Classic](../setup/switching-from-classic.mdx) documentation to learn more about the differences, and then view the [Migration utility](./classic-migration.mdx) documentation to prepare your site for migration. The migration is best run on Freeform 1.x for EE3-5.
:::

:::info
On August 29, 2022, all editions of Freeform were combined into a single **Freeform** edition at one price. Freeform includes all features previously only available to the _Pro_ edition. Anyone with an existing _Express_ or _Lite_ edition license purchased from the [EE Add-ons Store](https://expressionengine.com/add-ons/freeform) has automatically been upgraded to receive the complete (_Pro_) edition. The upgrade process to switch between an old edition to Freeform 3.x is the same as performing a regular update.
:::

Freeform has its own **Update Service** built in, which means that every time there's an update available, an **Updates Available** nav item will show up in the Freeform add-on area of the EE control panel. You can then review the changelog there, or [view it here](./changelog.mdx).
