# Installing & Updating

## Requirements

Solspace Freeform has mostly the same minimum requirements as listed on the [ExpressionEngine Requirements](https://docs.expressionengine.com/v7/installation/requirements.html) page:

- ExpressionEngine 7.x
- PHP 8.0 - 8.4
- [PHP iconv](http://php.net/manual/en/book.iconv.php) enabled
- MySQL 5.6 or newer

:::danger
Freeform 3.3.x no longer supports PHP 7.4. If you require PHP 7.4 support, please use Freeform 3.2.
:::

## Installing Instructions

1. Unzip the download package:
   - Open the **EE7** folder.
   - Copy the `freeform_next` folder to your EE site's `./system/user/addons/` directory.
   - Within the `themes` folder, copy the `freeform_next` folder to your EE site's `./themes/user/` directory.
2. Go to the _Add-Ons_ page and find _Freeform_ in the list, and click **Install**.

## Updating Instructions

:::warning
If you're switching from Freeform Classic to the new Freeform, please see the [Switching from Freeform Classic](../setup/switching-from-classic.mdx) documentation to learn more about the differences, and then view the [Migration utility](./classic-migration.mdx) documentation to prepare your site for migration. The migration is best run on Freeform 1.x for EE3-5.
:::

Freeform has its own **Update Service** built in, which means that every time there's an update available, an **Updates Available** nav item will show up in the Freeform add-on area of the EE control panel. You can then review the changelog there, or [view it here](./changelog.mdx).
