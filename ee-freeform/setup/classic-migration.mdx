# Freeform Migration Utility

:::warning
#### IMPORTANT
For the purpose of clarity in this documentation resource, any prior version of _Freeform (free)_ and _Freeform Pro _2.x_, _3.x_ 4.x_, _5.x_ and _6.x_ are referred to as <span className="text-amber-600 font-bold italic">Freeform Classic</span>. The **new** version of _Freeform_ is referred to as <span className="text-emerald-700 font-bold italic">Freeform Next</span>.
:::

It's important to note that Freeform <span className="text-emerald-600 font-semibold italic">Next</span> is not just merely an update or even an overhaul of <span className="text-amber-600 font-semibold italic">Classic</span> Freeform. It was completely rewritten from scratch, and built without attempting to conform to legacy requirements. Because of this, Freeform <span className="text-emerald-600 font-semibold italic">Next</span> is a completely different add-on with its own namespace / folder name, allowing you to install it alongside Freeform <span className="text-amber-600 font-semibold italic">Classic</span>.  In order to migrate your <span className="text-amber-600 font-semibold italic">Classic</span> data, you'll have to use this migration utility. And because not everything is the same in Freeform <span className="text-emerald-600 font-semibold italic">Next</span>, not everything can be migrated. This page will go into details on what to expect, and how you might need to prep your site before attempting migration, and then what to clean up afterwards.

:::info
You must have the appropriate EE-compatible version of Freeform <span className="text-amber-600 font-semibold italic">Classic</span> installed and upgraded for Freeform <span className="text-emerald-600 font-semibold italic">Next</span> to properly detect and migrate it. For example, if you moved from EE2 to EE4, but only have the EE2 version of Freeform <span className="text-amber-600 font-semibold italic">Classic</span> (4.x) installed, the migration won't work correctly. You'll need to update to the 5.x (EE3) or 6.x (EE4/EE5) version of Freeform <span className="text-amber-600 font-semibold italic">Classic</span> first. If you're switching from <span className="text-amber-600 font-semibold italic">Classic</span> to Freeform <span className="text-emerald-600 font-semibold italic">Next</span>, we don't expect you to pay an upgrade fee to access the EE3 or EE4 compatible versions of <span className="text-amber-600 font-semibold italic">Classic</span> to only use it for 15 mins to run the migration utility, so feel free to temporarily "borrow and reuse" a newer <span className="text-amber-600 font-semibold italic">Classic</span> license from another site if you have, or [contact us for a temporary copy](/support/).

## Quick Overview of Limitations

We figured it'd be helpful to place some of the large limitations of the migration utility at the start, so you could quickly see if migration is currently an option for you.

- Your <span className="text-emerald-600 font-semibold italic">Next</span> install needs to be fresh and untouched. The migration will overwrite any of your existing Freeform data. If you have modified your <span className="text-emerald-600 font-semibold italic">Next</span> install (created fields, etc) and you don't mind losing the data, you can reinstall Freeform <span className="text-emerald-600 font-semibold italic">Next</span> to run the migration.
- <span className="text-amber-600 font-semibold italic">Classic</span> Freeform fields that are loaded with Channel Entry data will be migrated over as empty fields, as support for this does not yet exist in Freeform <span className="text-emerald-600 font-semibold italic">Next</span>.
- Manually built EE Template based forms will be loaded into a new Composer-based form for Freeform <span className="text-emerald-600 font-semibold italic">Next</span>, as all forms are now setup inside Composer.
- Composer Templates (formatting templates for Composer-based forms) in <span className="text-amber-600 font-semibold italic">Classic</span> will not be migrated over. Freeform <span className="text-emerald-600 font-semibold italic">Next</span> has these as well, but the templating syntax is much more improved and very different.
- File Upload fields with _multiple files_ will be converted to having a single file upload input that can select multiple files at once (rather than showing multiple inputs).
- All associated _member data_ in <span className="text-amber-600 font-semibold italic">Classic</span> will not be migrated over, as Freeform <span className="text-emerald-600 font-semibold italic">Next</span> does not currently store any of that information.
- Currently not compatible with Multiple Site Manager (MSM). The migration will only migrate <span className="text-amber-600 font-semibold italic">Classic</span> data from Site 1. A future version might allow MSM compatibility.
- If something goes wrong with the migration, it will only affect your <span className="text-emerald-600 font-semibold italic">Next</span> install. This means it's fairly low risk to attempt the migration, as a failed migration can be resolved by reinstalling Freeform <span className="text-emerald-600 font-semibold italic">Next</span> and trying again (perhaps after a bug fix, or something in <span className="text-amber-600 font-semibold italic">Classic</span> adjusted).

## Fields

All fields will be attempted to be migrated over to the appropriate field equivalent. However, there will be some exceptions to this as follows:

- **Email** fields: Freeform <span className="text-emerald-600 font-semibold italic">Next</span> contains a special Email fieldtype that is like regular input fields, but includes an option to assign an email notification to it. The following <span className="text-amber-600 font-semibold italic">Classic</span> fields will be converted to Email fields (and cannot be undone):
  - All fields that contain the string `email` in it's label or short name.
  - All **Text** fields that contain the _Field Content Type_ of _Email_.
  :::info
  If you want to make sure fields are designated as _Email_ fieldtype, be sure they fall into the options listed above. If you do NOT want some fields to be converted to _Email_ fieldtype, be sure to rename (temporarily for migration) or reassign your fields' _Field Content Type_.
  :::
- **Multi-select** fields: while there is a Multi-select fieldtype in Freeform <span className="text-emerald-600 font-semibold italic">Next</span>, the migration does not account for this.
  - All <span className="text-amber-600 font-semibold italic">Classic</span> _Multi-select_ fields will be converted to _Checkbox Groups_.
- **Country** / **State** / **Province** Select fields: there isn't a concept of field types like this in Freeform <span className="text-emerald-600 font-semibold italic">Next</span>. While there is support for **Data Feeders** on Checkbox group, Radio group, Select and Multi-select fieldtypes in Freeform <span className="text-emerald-600 font-semibold italic">Next</span>, the migration will NOT automatically convert your existing fields to this new style.
  - All fields of this type will be converted to Select fields with those existing data options populated as their options.
  - A new field option called **Data Feeders** is available for Checkbox group, Radio group, Select and Multi-select fieldtypes.
    - You can populate these fields with Entries, Categories, Members, or one of our many predefined options: _States_, _Provinces_, _Countries_, _Languages_, _Number ranges_, _Year ranges_, _Months_, _Days_ and _Days of the Week_.
    - Freeform **Data Feeders** also offer flexible control over formatting and/or which data fills option labels and option values.

The following mapping of data will happen for each field during migration (<span className="text-amber-600 font-semibold italic">Classic</span> → <span className="text-emerald-600 font-semibold italic">Next</span>):

- _Field type_ → **Type**
- _Field Label_ → **Label**
- _Field Name_ → **Handle**
- _Description_ → <span className="inline-flex items-center rounded-md bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-400/10 px-1.5 py-0.5 text-xs font-medium text-red-700 dark:text-red-400 ring-1 ring-inset ring-red-600/10 dark:ring-red-400/20">Ignored</span>
- _Show field on submissions CP page?_ → <span className="inline-flex items-center rounded-md bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-400/10 px-1.5 py-0.5 text-xs font-medium text-red-700 dark:text-red-400 ring-1 ring-inset ring-red-600/10 dark:ring-red-400/20">Ignored</span>
- _Show field on moderation CP page?_ → <span className="inline-flex items-center rounded-md bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-400/10 px-1.5 py-0.5 text-xs font-medium text-red-700 dark:text-red-400 ring-1 ring-inset ring-red-600/10 dark:ring-red-400/20">Ignored</span>
- _Allow field to be used in Freeform Composer?_ → <span className="inline-flex items-center rounded-md bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-400/10 px-1.5 py-0.5 text-xs font-medium text-red-700 dark:text-red-400 ring-1 ring-inset ring-red-600/10 dark:ring-red-400/20">Ignored</span>
- _Add To Form(s)_ → <span className="inline-flex items-center rounded-md bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-400/10 px-1.5 py-0.5 text-xs font-medium text-red-700 dark:text-red-400 ring-1 ring-inset ring-red-600/10 dark:ring-red-400/20">Ignored</span>
- Field type Settings:
  - <span className="text-amber-600 font-semibold italic">Classic</span> allows a variety of ways to place the data for options:
    - _List (labels only)_ → **List of Labels**
    - _Value/Label List_ → **List of Labels and Options**
    - _Load from Channel Field_ → <span className="inline-flex items-center rounded-md bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-400/10 px-1.5 py-0.5 text-xs font-medium text-red-700 dark:text-red-400 ring-1 ring-inset ring-red-600/10 dark:ring-red-400/20">Ignored</span>
    - _Newline Delimited Textarea_ → **List of Labels**
  - **File Upload** fields:
    - _Allowed upload count_ → **File Count**
    - _File Upload Location_ → **Upload Directory**
    - _Allowed File Types_ (string) → **Allowed File Types** (checkboxes)
    - _Overwrite On Edit_ → <span className="inline-flex items-center rounded-md bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-400/10 px-1.5 py-0.5 text-xs font-medium text-red-700 dark:text-red-400 ring-1 ring-inset ring-red-600/10 dark:ring-red-400/20">Ignored</span>
    - _Disable XSS Clean_ → <span className="inline-flex items-center rounded-md bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-400/10 px-1.5 py-0.5 text-xs font-medium text-red-700 dark:text-red-400 ring-1 ring-inset ring-red-600/10 dark:ring-red-400/20">Ignored</span>

## Email Notification Templates

Email Notification templates are different in Freeform <span className="text-emerald-600 font-semibold italic">Next</span>, but the migration will bring them over, attempt to do some basic syntax updating, and attempt to map notification templates to forms (for Admin notifications). Be prepared to check this over after and update as necessary.

The following mapping of data will happen for each Email Notification Template during migration (<span className="text-amber-600 font-semibold italic">Classic</span> → <span className="text-emerald-600 font-semibold italic">Next</span>):

- _Label_ → **Name**
- _Name_ (aka `short_name`) → **Handle**
- _Description_ → **Description**
- _Subject_ → **Subject**
- _From Name_ → **From Name**
- _From Email_ → **From Email**
- _Reply To Email_ → **Reply-to Email**
- _Include Attachments_ → **Include Attachments**
- _Word Wrap_ → <span className="inline-flex items-center rounded-md bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-400/10 px-1.5 py-0.5 text-xs font-medium text-red-700 dark:text-red-400 ring-1 ring-inset ring-red-600/10 dark:ring-red-400/20">Ignored</span>
- _Allow HTML_ → <span className="inline-flex items-center rounded-md bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-400/10 px-1.5 py-0.5 text-xs font-medium text-red-700 dark:text-red-400 ring-1 ring-inset ring-red-600/10 dark:ring-red-400/20">Ignored</span> (all emails are HTML)
  - Migration will attempt to make some basic string find/replace, but you'll want to check things over after the migration:
    - `{all_form_fields}{/all_form_fields}` → `{form:fields}{/form:fields}`
    - `{field_label}` → `{field:label}`
    - `{field_data}` → `{field:value}`
    - `{entry_date format=""}` → `{date_created format=""}`
    - `{freeform_entry_id}` → `{submission:id}`
    - `{form_label}` → `{form:name}`
    - `{form_name}` → `{form:handle}`
    - `{form_id}` → `{form:id}`

## Formatting Templates

Formatting templates, or _Composer Templates_ as they're called in <span className="text-amber-600 font-semibold italic">Classic</span>, are all stored in database, whereas Freeform <span className="text-emerald-600 font-semibold italic">Next</span> stores only in HTML files. The template code is much more improvement and very different, so these will be excluded from migration and need to be rebuilt. Freeform <span className="text-emerald-600 font-semibold italic">Next</span> includes several sample formatting templates including popular HTML frameworks to get you started.

## Statuses

Classic stores statuses in the Preferences page, whereas Freeform <span className="text-emerald-600 font-semibold italic">Next</span> has an interface for creating and editing them (including colors). Any additional statuses (if present) in <span className="text-amber-600 font-semibold italic">Classic</span> preferences will be migrated over:

- <span className="text-amber-600 font-semibold italic">Classic</span> `status_name` → mapped to **Name** and **Handle**, with gray color assigned.

## Forms

The biggest improvement to Freeform <span className="text-emerald-600 font-semibold italic">Next</span> is the way forms are handled and the intuitive Composer interface. Freeform <span className="text-amber-600 font-semibold italic">Classic</span> allowed _Composer_-based forms and _EE Template_-based forms, whereas Freeform <span className="text-emerald-600 font-semibold italic">Next</span> only offers _Composer_-based forms (though you can similarly built very manual forms if you still wish to). Because of this, the migration has a little more work to do, but it should get most of the work done for you.

Freeform <span className="text-amber-600 font-semibold italic">Classic</span> manual _EE Template_-based forms still have to have fields assigned to the form, so the Migration utility will know which fields to grab and assign to forms (and place into Composer). The following mapping of data will happen for each Form during migration (<span className="text-amber-600 font-semibold italic">Classic</span> → <span className="text-emerald-600 font-semibold italic">Next</span>):

- _Form Type_ → <span className="inline-flex items-center rounded-md bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-400/10 px-1.5 py-0.5 text-xs font-medium text-red-700 dark:text-red-400 ring-1 ring-inset ring-red-600/10 dark:ring-red-400/20">Ignored</span>
- _Form Label_ → **Name**
- _Form Name_ → **Handle**
- _Description_ → **Description**
- _Default Status_ → **Default Status**
- _Notify User_ → <span className="inline-flex items-center rounded-md bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-400/10 px-1.5 py-0.5 text-xs font-medium text-red-700 dark:text-red-400 ring-1 ring-inset ring-red-600/10 dark:ring-red-400/20">Ignored</span> (now applied directly to **Email** fieldtype instead)
- _User Email Field_ → <span className="inline-flex items-center rounded-md bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-400/10 px-1.5 py-0.5 text-xs font-medium text-red-700 dark:text-red-400 ring-1 ring-inset ring-red-600/10 dark:ring-red-400/20">Ignored</span>
- _User Email Notification Template_ → <span className="inline-flex items-center rounded-md bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-400/10 px-1.5 py-0.5 text-xs font-medium text-red-700 dark:text-red-400 ring-1 ring-inset ring-red-600/10 dark:ring-red-400/20">Ignored</span>
- _Notify Admin_ → if YES, attempt to connect form the options below:
  - _Admin Notification Template_ → **Email Template**
  - _Admin Email Notification Email Address_ → **Admin Recipients**
- _Form Fields_ (if EE Template-based) → **Inserted into Composer layout** in order of how fields were set in <span className="text-amber-600 font-semibold italic">Classic</span>. 
  - Migration adds a **Submit button** at the end of the Composer form.
  - Fields can of course be rearrange later as desired.
- _Form Fields in Composer interface_ (if Composer-based) → **Inserted into Composer layout** in position order from <span className="text-amber-600 font-semibold italic">Classic</span>. 
  - Rows and columns will attempt to be respected.
  - _Dynamic Recipients_ and _User Recipients_ fields → <span className="inline-flex items-center rounded-md bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-400/10 px-1.5 py-0.5 text-xs font-medium text-red-700 dark:text-red-400 ring-1 ring-inset ring-red-600/10 dark:ring-red-400/20">Ignored</span> (due to how things are different in <span className="text-emerald-600 font-semibold italic">Next</span> - will have to be recreated manually.
  - _Title block_ in Composer → <span className="inline-flex items-center rounded-md bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-400/10 px-1.5 py-0.5 text-xs font-medium text-red-700 dark:text-red-400 ring-1 ring-inset ring-red-600/10 dark:ring-red-400/20">Ignored</span>
  - _Paragraph block_ in Composer → Converted to **HTML block**
  - _Page breaks_ in <span className="text-amber-600 font-semibold italic">Classic</span> → Converted to **Page tabs**
- _View Freeform Entry URL_ → <span className="inline-flex items-center rounded-md bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-400/10 px-1.5 py-0.5 text-xs font-medium text-red-700 dark:text-red-400 ring-1 ring-inset ring-red-600/10 dark:ring-red-400/20">Ignored</span>

## Submissions

Submissions can be migrated from <span className="text-amber-600 font-semibold italic">Classic</span> as well. However, this is an optional step. If you wish to have your submissions migrated to Freeform <span className="text-emerald-600 font-semibold italic">Next</span>, be sure to check the **Migrate Submissions** checkbox on the Migration utility page.

All field data will be mapped over. Some exceptions to this are:

- <span className="text-amber-600 font-semibold italic">Classic</span> Freeform fields that are **loaded with Channel Entry data** will be migrated over as empty fields, as support for this does not yet exist in Freeform <span className="text-emerald-600 font-semibold italic">Next</span>.
- **File Upload** fields with _multiple files_ will be converted to having a single file upload input that can select multiple files at once (rather than showing multiple inputs).
- All associated **member data** in <span className="text-amber-600 font-semibold italic">Classic</span> will not be migrated over, as Freeform <span className="text-emerald-600 font-semibold italic">Next</span> does not currently store any of that information.
- **Field Layouts** (submissions list page) in <span className="text-amber-600 font-semibold italic">Classic</span> will be ignored and need to be recreated.

Migrated submissions will have a title of something like `Legacy Submission #7 (Migrated)`. This is because Freeform <span className="text-emerald-600 font-semibold italic">Next</span> introduces a title generating feature for submissions, based on your fields (e.g. _Submission Title_ = `{first_name}` + `{last_name}`). The migration utility cannot guess what you might want your titles to be, so we used something obvious. These can manually be updated if you wish (but no way to retroactively update these unfortunately).

## Preferences

The preferences/settings are very different between <span className="text-amber-600 font-semibold italic">Classic</span> and Freeform <span className="text-emerald-600 font-semibold italic">Next</span>. No action will happen here during migration, with the exception of migration of [statuses](#statuses).

## Permissions

Freeform <span className="text-emerald-600 font-semibold italic">Next</span> currently does not have permission controls. A future version will, but until then, no <span className="text-amber-600 font-semibold italic">Classic</span> permissions will be migrated over.

## Clean-up

Once the migration utility has completed, review your forms, fields, notification templates and submission data to ensure everything is as expected.

If there are any issues you suspect are a bug, please let us know through a [support ticket](/support/) before proceeding any further. We may be able to resolve an issue and you can try running migration again.

Proceed to adjusting your forms, fields, notification templates, etc and update your EE templates to use Freeform <span className="text-emerald-600 font-semibold italic">Next</span> template tags. You can install the demo templates included with Freeform <span className="text-emerald-600 font-semibold italic">Next</span> to see everything in action right away. Refer to the [Switching from](./switching-from-classic.mdx) documentation for more information.

It's recommended that you leave your old <span className="text-amber-600 font-semibold italic">Classic</span> install and its data in place until a few weeks after you've moved on with Freeform <span className="text-emerald-600 font-semibold italic">Next</span>. That way, if something did go wrong along the way, we may be able to resolve a bug or issue, and then you can redo the migration.
