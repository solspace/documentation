## New Purchases of Freeform

Freeform is available for purchase via the [EE Add-ons Store](https://expressionengine.com/add-ons).

## Upgrading

:::info
On August 29, 2022, all editions of Freeform were combined into a single **Freeform** edition at one price. Freeform includes all features previously only available to the _Pro_ edition. Anyone with an existing _Express_ or _Lite_ edition license purchased from the [EE Add-ons Store](https://expressionengine.com/add-ons/freeform) has automatically been upgraded to receive the complete (_Pro_) edition. The upgrade process to switch between an old edition to Freeform 3.x is the same as performing a regular update.
