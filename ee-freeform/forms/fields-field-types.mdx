# Fields & Field Types

Freeform uses its own set of fields and field types. Using a predefined set of fields also gives us the control to more easily account for how each form field should be displayed in Composer's live preview, and provides a smoother experience.

## Fields Overview

Fields are global and available to all forms, but they can also be overwritten per form. This allows you to save time reusing existing fields when making other forms, but also gives you flexibility to make adjustments to them when needed. So to clarify, you can create fields with labels and options that are common to all forms, but also override those on each form. For example, if you have a field named **Cell Phone**, on the form level, you can rename the field name to **Mobile Phone**, or if you have a Checkbox Group field with options: **Option 1**, **Option 2**, and **Option 3**, you could override it to just have 2 options with values of **Option A** and **Option B**. When the fields are edited at global level (in main Fields area of Freeform control panel), your customizations per form will NOT be lost.

Fields can be created and managed in the main field creation area (**Freeform → Fields → New Field**) and can also be created directly within the _Composer_ interface as well. Fields created here are available globally as well (they do not just exist for that form).

Some important notes:

- All field properties can be overwritten at form level inside Composer, including the field Handle.
- Once a field is created, you cannot change the field type after.
- Freeform will load fields of [Hidden](#fields-hidden) type at the beginning of the form, regardless of where they are placed in Composer layout.

## Field Types

The following field types are available ([see below for additional advanced field types](#advanced-field-types)):

### Text

A simple input field. Its handle inside a formatting template is `text`.

- Can be marked as required.
- Can contain default text and/or placeholder.
- Can set `maxlength` property.

### Textarea

A simple multi-line input field. Its handle inside a formatting template is `textarea`.

- Specify the number of rows the textarea should have.
- Can be marked as required.
- Can contain default text and/or placeholder.
- Can set `maxlength` property.
- Will automatically convert newlines to line breaks when outputting data in templates or email notifications.

### Email

An input field that is flagged in Freeform to expect an email address value as well as possibility for receiving email notifications. Its handle inside a formatting template is `email`.

- In the Property Editor (right column) in Composer, select a notification template if you want the email entered for this field to receive an email notification.
- To allow sending of email notifications to more than 1 email address (e.g. in the case of a "Tell-a-Friend" type form), you can add multiple input fields, each with the name `email[]`. This approach would require that you code this part manually however.
- Required field type if you wish for your users to receive an email notification.
- Required field type if you're using with a Mailing List API integration.
- Can be marked as required.
- Can contain default text and/or placeholder.

### Hidden

A hidden field. Its handle inside a formatting template is `hidden`.

- Can only include text strings at this time (no variables allowed).
  - If you need you pass a value to your hidden field dynamically, you can do so with the `override_values` parameter, e.g. `override_values:FIELD_NAME="myvalue"`
- Cannot be marked as required.
- Freeform will load fields of this type at the beginning of the form, regardless of where they are placed in Composer layout.

### Select

A select dropdown menu field. Its handle inside a formatting template is `select`.

- Can specify labels (with values assumed) or labels and values (that differ).
  - To make the first option empty, use **labels and values** approach with first option having **--** or **Please select...**, etc for the label, and leave option blank.
- Can be automatically populated with select [EE Data or Pre-defined list options](#populating-fields-with-ee-data-predefined-options).
- Can be marked as required.

### Multiple Select

A multiple select field. Its handle inside a formatting template is `multiple_select`.

- Can specify labels (with values assumed) or labels and values (that differ).
- Can be automatically populated with select [EE Data or Pre-defined list options](#populating-fields-with-ee-data-predefined-options).
- Can be marked as required.
- Can specify default option(s) to be selected.

### Checkbox

A single checkbox field. Its handle inside a formatting template is `checkbox`.

- Has a default value of **Yes**, which can be overwritten with any value you want. The front end however, will always display the value as `1`, but upon submission, the value will be switched to the one you have set.
- Can be marked as required, which would essentially require that this checkbox be checked.
- Can be checked by default.

#### Field Specific Properties

- `{field:checked}` - will display whether the field is checked by default.

### Checkbox Group

A group of checkboxes. Its handle inside a formatting template is `checkbox_group`.

### File Upload

A file upload field, using [EE File Uploads](https://docs.expressionengine.com/v7/add-ons/file/file_tag.html). Its handle inside a formatting template is `file`.

Can allow a single file or multiple files (applies `multiple` attribute to the single file upload input) to be uploaded.

- Specify a number larger than `1` in the **File Count** setting to allow multiple files to be uploaded at the same time.
- Must have an Upload Directory Preference where the file will be uploaded to.
- Be sure that the EE Upload Directory's _Allowed file types?_ preference is set to **All file types**, even if you're only using images.
- Define maximum file size (in KB). Default is 2048 KB (2MB). Is subject to:
  - PHP [memory_limit](http://us3.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.memory-limit)
  - PHP [post_max_size](http://us3.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.post-max-size)
  - PHP [upload_max_filesize](http://us3.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.upload-max-filesize)
- Select which file types can be uploaded.
  - Leaving all options unchecked will allow ALL file types.
- In [multi-page forms](../forms/multi-page-forms.mdx), if an earlier page contains file upload field(s), files will actually be uploaded before the form is officially submitted.
  - If the form is never completed, incomplete submissions are stored for 3hrs, and then are removed (along with the file(s)) after that.

- Specify labels and email address values.

  - Emails are never parsed in source code (they're replaced with **0**, **1**, **2**, etc).
    :::info
    When parsing this field semi-manually, be sure to use `{field:index}` to generate numeric values of options instead of `{field:value}`.
    :::

    ```html
    <select name="{field:department:handle}" type="dynamic_recipients">
        {field:department:options}
            <option value="{option:index}" {if option:checked}selected{/if}>
                {option:label}
            </option>
        {/field:department:options}

<Photo
  img={require('@site/static/img/ee/freeform/v3/templates_table-field.png')}
  alt="Table fieldtype"
/>

When rendering this fieldtype automatically in a loop iterating over all fields, these additional parameters are available to adjust it:

```twig showLineNumbers
{field:render_input
    class="table"
	add_button_label="Add +"
	add_button_class="btn btn-small btn-primary"
	remove_button_label="x"
	remove_button_class="btn btn-small btn-danger"
	table_text_input_class="form-control"
	table_select_input_class="form-control"
	table_checkbox_input_class="form-check-input"
}
```

When manually rendering, the following markup is available:

```html showLineNumbers
{field:render_label label_class="{if field:required}required{/if}"}
{field:layout}
<table class="form-table table" id="form-input-{field:handle}">
   <thead>
      <tr>
      {layout:columns}
         <th>{column:label}</th>
      {/layout:columns}
         <th>&nbsp;</th>
      </tr>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
      {layout:rows}
         <tr>
            {row:columns}
               <td>
               {if column:type == "string"}
                  <input type="text" class="form-control" name="{field:handle}[{column:row_index}][{column:index}]" value="{column:value}" data-default-value="{column:default_value}" />
               {if:elseif column:type == "select"}
                  <select name="{field:handle}[{column:row_index}][{column:index}]"class="form-control">
                  {column:options}
                     <option value="{option:value}"{if column:value == option:value} selected{/if}>{option:value}</option>
                  {/column:options}
                  </select>
               {if:elseif column:type == "checkbox"}
                  <input type="checkbox" name="{field:handle}[{column:row_index}][{column:index}]" class="form-check-input" value="{column:default_value}" data-default-value="{column:default_value}"{if column:value} checked{/if} />
               {/if}
               </td>
            {/row:columns}
         <td><button class="form-table-remove-row btn btn-small btn-danger" type="button">x</button></td>
      </tr>
      {/layout:rows}
   </tbody>
</table>
<button class="form-table-add-row btn btn-small btn-primary" data-target="form-input-{field:handle}" type="button">Add +</button>
{/field:layout}
```

This can also be used inside of the `submission:fields` variable pair of the [Submissions template tag](../templating/submissions.mdx) as well.

Here's a breakdown of the available variable pairs and variables for the Table field when rendering manually:

- `{field:layout}{/field:layout}` - variable pair to handle the overall formatting of the Table field.
  - `{layout:columns}{/layout:columns}` - variable pair that handles formatting of table column labels.
    - `{column:label}` - outputs the table column labels.
  - `{layout:rows}{/layout:rows}` - variable pair that handles the formatting of table rows.
    - `{row:index}` - the index of each row.
    - `{row:columns}{/row:columns}` - variable pair that handles formatting of each row column.
      - `{column:row_index}` and `{column:index}` help generate the field input names, e.g. `name="{field:handle}[{column:row_index}][{column:index}]"`.
      - `{column:type}` - displays the type of field for the column, e.g. `select` or `string` (text).
      - `{column:label}` - the label for the table column headings.
      - `{column:value}` - the currently entered/selected value of a field (used for loading the previously submitted date when an error causes form to reload, or when in edit mode).
      - `{column:default_value}` - the default value for the given field.
      - `{column:input}` - generates an input for regular text inputs.
      - `{column:options}{/column:options}` - variable pair used to handle formatting of **Select** field type options.
      - `{option:value}` - displays the option value for each select option.

- Can be marked as required.
- Can contain default text and/or placeholder.

## Special Fields

Special fields are ones that either every form needs (such as Submit button) and ones that aid in the layout and content of forms (such as the HTML block). None of these fields store any submission data in the database. The following special fields are available to use:

### Submit

A Submit button for submitting the form.

- Settings allow you to edit the button label.
- You may adjust the positioning of the submit button:
  - Aligned to Left
  - Aligned to Center
  - Aligned to Right
- When using with multi-page forms, Freeform will detect when you're on a page after first page, and provide you with additional options:
  - It will include a Previous button by default, allowing the user to go back to previous pages in the form.
    - Previous button can be disabled.
  - Positioning options now include:
    - Apart at Left and Right
    - Together at Left
    - Together at Center
    - Together at Right
- You may include 1 per page in your form.

#### Field Specific Properties

- `{field:label_next}`
  - A label for the **Next** button. `Submit` by default.
- `{field:label_prev}`
  - A label for the **Previous** button. `Previous` by default.
- `{field:disable_prev}`
  - A boolean value. If `true` the **Previous** button should not be rendered.

### HTML

An HTML block for adding your own HTML into the form layout.

- Property Editor will load an HTML area for you to type or paste your code into.
- Layout column will live parse your HTML.
- All HTML is allowed here.
- You can include as many of these in your form as you wish.

### reCAPTCHA v2 Checkbox

Built in support for [reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha). _reCAPTCHA_ fields will render automatically like the rest of your fields in your form, but if you're building a form manually, you'd call it like this (using the Hash value for _reCAPTCHA_ field in Property Editor of Composer): `{field:grecaptcha_MD1KzPw68:render}`

See [reCAPTCHA documentation](./spam-protection.mdx#recaptcha) for more information.

## Populating Fields with EE Data & Predefined Options
