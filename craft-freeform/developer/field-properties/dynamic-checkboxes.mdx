The `#[DynamicCheckboxes]` property type will render a list of checkboxes that populates its options from an endpoint.
You can also configure it to read other properties from the same field to pass as parameters to the endpoint.
Each time a property that is used in this select changes, the options will be re-fetched from the endpoint.

:::warning
Currently, the endpoint will always start from the `/admin/freeform` base path if a relative URL is used.
So if your endpoint is `/api/foods`, the full URL will be `/admin/freeform/api/foods`.
Make sure your endpoint is accessible from that path, or use an absolute URL instead.

Please contact us if this is a problem for your use case.

```php showLineNumbers
use Solspace\Freeform\Attributes\Property\Input\DynamicCheckboxes;
// ...

#[DynamicCheckboxes(
    label: 'Select a food',
    instructions: 'Choose your favorite food from the list.',
    source: 'http://localhost:3000/api/foods',
    parameterFields: [
        'properties.defaultValue' => 'defaultValue',
        'properties.value' => 'currentValue',
        'properties.label' => 'label',
    ],
)]
protected string $favoriteFood = '';
```

The `parameterFields` option is an associative array where the keys are the property paths to read from the current field,
and the values are the parameter names to send to the endpoint.

The resulting url call would look like this for a Form with ID `123` if the field had the following properties:
- `defaultValue = "sushi"`
- `value = "pizza"`
- `label = "Choose your favorite food"`

```
http://localhost:3000/api/foods?formId=123&defaultValue=sushi&currentValue=pizza&label=Choose+your+favorite+food
```
