## Generate Fake Submissions<Badge type="feature" text="5.1.14+" />

If you ever need to generate fake submission data for testing purposes, you can do so with the `freeform/submissions/generate` CLI command.

Freeform will attempt to automatically generate content and select options for all of your form fields. For example, it will know that an **Email** field should contain an email address, a **Number** field should contain a number, a **Date** field will contain a valid date, a field with the word `name` in it should contain a name, it should check a few options in a **Checkboxes** field, etc. Please note that some of these checks like _name_ may rely more on the English language. The creation date defaults to today but can be overridden. However, the times are always random within the specified period.

### Options

The following arguments are available:

- `--author-id`, `-a`
  - The user ID to be assigned as the author of the generated submissions. Defaults to none (guest).
  - E.g. `--author-id=1`, `-a=12`
- `--count=10`, `-c`
  - The number of submissions to generate. Defaults to `1`.
  - E.g. `--count=10`, `-c=100`.
- `--dry-run`
  - Displays a sample generated submission inside the CLI without actually creating the submissions in Freeform/Craft, allowing you to get a rough idea of what it will generate. Defaults to off.
- `--form`, `-f` <span className="red">\*required</span>
  - The handle or ID of the form you wish to generate submissions for.
  - E.g. `--form=contactForm`, `--form=12`, `-f=2`.
- `--locale`, `-l`
  - The locale to use when generating submissions. Defaults to `en_US`.
  - E.g. `--locale=fr`, `--locale=fr_FR`, `-l=de`.
- `--range-start`, `-rs`
  - The starting date period to generate submissions between. Can also use relative wording, e.g. `3 weeks ago`. Defaults to `today`.
  - E.g. `--range-start="2024-03-01"`, `--range-start="-1 week"`, `--range-start="3 weeks ago"`.
- `--range-end`, `-re`
  - The ending date period to generate submissions between. Can also use relative wording. Defaults to `today`.
  - E.g. `--range-end="2024-12-31"`, `--range-end="+1 week"`, `--range-end="2 days"`.
- `--spam`
  - Flags all submissions as spam so they appear in the Freeform [Spam Folder](../forms/spam-protection.mdx#spam-folder).
- `--status`, `-s`
  - The handle of ID of the status(es) to be used when generating submissions. Can be set to multiple comma-separated statuses. Defaults to using the default status set inside the form builder for the form.
  - E.g. `--status="open,pending,closed"`, `--status="testing"`, `-s=pending`.
- `--verbose`, `-v`
  - Displays in the CLI all of the generated submission data that it created in Freeform/Craft. Defaults to off.

### Examples

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="fake-submissions-basic" label="Basic" default>

Generate 10 spam submissions in French to the `contactForm` form:

```sh
php craft freeform/submissions/generate --form=contactForm --spam --count=10 --locale=fr
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="fake-submissions-date-ranges" label="Date Ranges">

Generate 100 submissions in English to the `survey2024` form between 3 weeks ago and tomorrow:

```sh
php craft freeform/submissions/generate --form=survey2024 --count=100 --locale=en --range-start="3 weeks ago" --range-end="tomorrow"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="fake-submissions-statuses" label="Statuses">

Generate 50 submissions in English to the `quoteRequest` form with a mix of the statuses `open`, `pending`, and `closed`:

```sh
php craft freeform/submissions/generate -f=quoteRequest -c=50 -l=en -s="open,pending,closed"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="fake-submissions-statuses-skewed-ratio" label="Statuses with Skewed Ratio">

Generate 50 submissions in English to the `quoteRequest` form with a mix of the statuses `open` and `closed`, with a much higher proportion of them being `open`:

```sh
php craft freeform/submissions/generate -f=quoteRequest -c=50 -l=en -s="open,open,open,open,closed"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Resave Submissions<Badge type="feature" text="5.1.13+" />

If you need to resave all Freeform submissions, you can do so with the `freeform/submissions/resave` CLI command. Most of the arguments available to Craft's `resave/entries` command are available here too, so if you need to also update the Craft Search Index, be sure to add `--update-search-index`.

```sh
php craft freeform/submissions/resave --update-search-index
```

## Migrate Craft 4 Element Titles<Badge type="feature" text="5.1.13+" />

If you have upgraded your Craft 4 site to Craft 5, please note that the Craft migration process does not automatically migrate submission Element titles. In Craft 5, Element titles are now stored in the `elements_sites` table, and the `content` table which used to store Element titles is no longer used.

While most plugins could include a separate migration script to handle this, Freeform 5 supports both Craft 4 and Craft 5, making this path impossible. Instead, a CLI command has been included that needs to be executed once after upgrading from Craft 4 to Craft 5.

:::warning
This CLI command is only applicable to sites that have migrated from Craft 4 to Craft 5 while Freeform was installed.
:::

```sh
php craft freeform/submissions/fix-titles
```

## Convert Form Handles and Field Handles<Badge type="feature" text="5.9.11+" />

This console command is available in the event you need to convert all form handles and field handles to _camelCase_ or _under_scores_. This allows you to correct your data from much older versions of Freeform where dashes were allowed inside of form handles and field handles.

Common reasons for using this command would be:

- To correct compatibility with GraphQL.
- Dashes in forms and field handles are now considered invalid for Craft.
- You want all of your forms and field handles to be more uniform.

:::warning
After running this command, please review all templates and email notification templates to ensure that any hard-coded form handles and field handles are updated to match their new converted values.
:::

### Options

The following arguments are available:

- `--case`, `-c`
  - Convert dashes to underscores instead of _camelCase_. When not used, defaults to _camelCase_.
  - E.g. `--case=underscores`, `-c=undercores`.
- `--dry-run`
  - Displays a list of all of the form and field handles that will be converted, as well as what they will be converted to inside the CLI without actually making the changes, allowing you to know what to expect. Defaults to off.

### Examples

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="convert-handles-camel-case" label="Camel Case" default>

Convert all forms and field handles with dashes to _camelCase_, e.g. `my-field` becomes `myField`, `My_other_field` becomes `myOtherField`.

```sh
php craft freeform/freeform/convert-handles
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="convert-handles-underscores" label="Underscores">

Convert all forms and field handles with dashes to _underscores_, e.g. `my-field` becomes `my_field`.

```sh
php craft freeform/freeform/convert-handles --case underscores
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="convert-handles-dry-run" label="Dry Run">

Perform a dry run of the command to see which form and field handles will be converted without actually making the changes.

```sh
php craft freeform/freeform/convert-handles --dryRun
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Purge Commands

Freeform automatically attempts to routinely execute all of the below commands as Craft jobs, but they are available in the event you need to correct or troubleshoot an issue.

### Purge Submissions<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

Allows you to purge all submissions older than a specific number of days. Freeform automatically attempts to execute this service based on the specified number of days for the **Automatically Purge Submission Data** setting.

```sh
php craft freeform/purge/submissions --age-in-days=30
```

### Purge Spam<BadgeGroup><Badge type="lite" text="Lite" /><Badge type="pro" text="Pro" /></BadgeGroup>

Allows you to purge all spam submissions older than a specific number of days. Freeform automatically attempts to execute this service based on the specified number of days for the **Automatically Purge Spam Submissions** setting.

```sh
php craft freeform/purge/spam --age-in-days=30
```

### Purge Unfinalized Assets

Allows you to purge all unfinalized assets older than a specific number of minutes. Freeform automatically attempts to execute this service every 3 hours.
