This will prevent the form from double-submitting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |    <span class="edition-express">✓</span>    |  <span class="edition-lite">✓</span>   |  <span class="edition-pro">✓</span>  |

### Script Insert Location

The location of where you want Freeform to insert it's scripts for form and field functionality (such as spam protection and advanced field types).

- **Page Footer** <Badge type="recommended" text="Recommended" />
- **Page Header** <Badge type="feature" text="New in 5.0+" />
- **Inside Form**
- **None** (manually load the JS instead)
  - If you choose this option, please be sure to manually load Freeform's JS with `/freeform/plugin.js` and CSS with `/freeform/plugin.css` (optional, as it's currently just for the Opinion field type handling) in your template(s). See [Freeform JS plugin](../developer/js-plugin.mdx#loading-freeform-js-manually) documentation for more information.

### Freeform Session Context<Badge type="feature" text="Deprecated in 5.0+" />

Choose the way form context is passed between form submits.

:::warning
The _PHP Sessions_ and _Database Table_ options for the Freeform Session Context setting are deprecated and are planned to be removed in Freeform 6. Encrypted Payload continues to be the assumed and recommended approach, but can still be overrided to PHP Sessions or Database Table in project config.

Options are:

- `sessionContext: payload` (default)
- `sessionContext: session`
- `sessionContext: database`

:::

- **As an encrypted payload** <Badge type="recommended" text="Default/Recommended" />
  - The key benefits are that it never stores anything anywhere, has no impact on the server, and can be cached out-of-the-box.
- **Using PHP's sessions**
  - The key benefits are that it stores the context in memory and everything per session ID.
  - The problems with this approach are that it expires eventually with no way to persist this for longer periods of time. It's also unreliable due to _garbage collection_ on most servers which typically runs every 24 min­utes by default.
- **Using a database table**
  - The key benefits are that the context is stored in the database reliably for as long as you wish, offering more control if you have large forms that take a very long time to complete.
  - The problems with this approach is that high traffic sites may run into performance issues as the database table fills up and attempts to clear regularly, etc.

### Formatting Templates

[Formatting Templates](../templates/formatting/index.mdx) are predefined templates that you can specify for forms to handle simplified rendering of the form on the front end. You can have as many as you wish, and customize them however you like.

| Setting                                        | Project Config                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | <span class="edition-express">Express</span> | <span class="edition-lite">Lite</span> | <span class="edition-pro">Pro</span> |

| <span class="nowrap">**Directory Path**</span> | `formTemplateDirectory: _freeform/formatting/` | When using custom formatting templates for your forms, you'll need to specify where your Twig-based templates are stored. Provide a relative path to craft root to your custom form templates directory, e.g. `freeform_formatting_templates`. To add a starter example template, click the "Add a sample template" button, and then edit the template after. |    <span class="edition-express">✓</span>    |  <span class="edition-lite">✓</span>   |  <span class="edition-pro">✓</span>  |

### Email Templates

Email Notification templates are available to be stored as files, in the database, or both. You can choose which one is best for your site. In order to send file-based email notifications, a directory path must be set for Freeform to manage these templates, as they are stored as Twig-based files. See [Email Notifications](../forms/email-notifications.mdx) documentation for more information about implementation.

If you have not yet created the directory, please do that before filling in this setting. This allows you to use Twig template files for your email formatting and allows Freeform to locate these files when setting up notifications, e.g. `_freeform_notifications`. To add a starter example template, click the "Add a sample template" button, and then edit the template after. |    <span class="edition-express">✓</span>    |  <span class="edition-lite">✓</span>   |  <span class="edition-pro">✓</span>  |

:::info
If you wish to create advanced notification templates, please note that any additional template files (e.g. `_layout.twig`, `_footer.html`, etc) must NOT be stored inside of this directory, as Freeform expects that every file in here is a complete email notification template and will choke on any additional files.
:::

#### Convert Database email templates to File email templates

This is a utility that allows you to migrate your existing database email templates over to file-based email templates (you can continue to edit these from the CP). The utility will also update all existing forms to use the new file version of the email template. If you wish to have Freeform clean up and remove the old database email templates after, check the checkbox as well.

### Success Templates

Success templates are predefined templates that you can specify for your forms to display when a form has been successfully submitted. Instead of redirecting to a return URL or reloading the form, it'll display the contents of this template. You can have as many as you wish, and customize them however you like. To use these, be sure to select the **Load Success Template** option for the **Success Behavior** setting in the form builder for each form.

| <span class="nowrap">**Directory Path**</span> | `successTemplateDirectory: _freeform/success/` | When using custom formatting templates for your forms, you'll need to specify where your Twig-based templates are stored. Provide a relative path to craft root to your custom form templates directory, e.g. `freeform_success`. To add a starter example template, click the "Add a sample template" button, and then edit the template after. |    <span class="edition-express">✓</span>    |  <span class="edition-lite">✓</span>   |  <span class="edition-pro">✓</span>  |

Your success template might look something like this:

```twig showLineNumbers
<div id="freeform-success">
    <h3>Thank you!</h3>
    <p>We have successfully received your submission.</p>
</div>
```

Things like `form.id`, `form.handle` and `form.name` are available for use here as well.

## PDF Templates <Badge type="pro" text="Pro" /><Badge type="feature" text="New in 5.7+" />

You can create an unlimited number of custom PDF's to be generated for email notifications. You are in full control to build beautiful HTML-based templates and dynamically pull in form and submission data. In the [Email Notifications](../forms/email-notifications.mdx) area, when editing an email notification template, you can then assign which PDF template(s) should be included with it.

The file name and PDF body may contain any of the [Twig variables](../forms/email-notifications.mdx#template-options) available in the body of email notification templates. Please [see documentation](../forms/email-notifications.mdx#template-options) for more information.

Each PDF template contains the following:

- Name
- Description
- File Name (the name of the PDF file when it's generated - can use Twig variables)
- PDF Body (uses HTML and can include Twig variables)

## Error Log

In as many cases as possible, Freeform attempts to write errors and issues to its own error log. The file is physically located in the same place as the Craft logs (`/storage/logs/freeform.log`), but can be conveniently viewed inside the _Error Log_ page inside Freeform Settings area (**Freeform** → **Settings** → **Error Log**). If there are no logged errors, the Error Log page will not show any errors, and you will likely not see the Freeform error log file.

:::info
This page remains accessible when the Craft `allowAdminChanges` config setting is set to `false`.
