# Deleting Submissions By Token

Freeform includes a way for users to delete their own submissions. This can be done with the **token** feature. A typical setup might have you include a link inside an email notification sent to a user that filled out a form. You would include the `submission.token` in the URL you generate that is linked to a template with the below example code to allow the user to delete their own submission.

```twig showLineNumbers
{% set token = craft.app.request.segment(4) %}

{% if freeform.deleteSubmissionByToken(token) %}
	Removed successfully
{% else %}
	Nothing to remove
{% endif %}
```
