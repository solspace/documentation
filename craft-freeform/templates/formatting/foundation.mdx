# Foundation<Badge type="deprecated" text="Deprecated" />

Freeform includes a sample formatting template built to work with [Foundation](https://get.foundation). When using this
templates, Freeform assumes that the required Foundation styles and components are already included in your project.
While this template may not work for all sites out of the box, it provides a solid starting point for building your own.

The following is available:

<ul className="sample-templates-list">
  <li><img src="/icons/integrations/foundation.svg" alt="Foundation" />Foundation 6<Badge type="deprecated" text="Deprecated" /></li>
</ul>
