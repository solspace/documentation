# Gemini AI<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" /><Badge type="feature" text="New in 5.12+" />

This integration allows you to use [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com)'s AI models for processing in form submissions.

Once you enable and configure an AI integration, the [AI field type](../forms/fields.mdx#ai) becomes available in your forms. Use it to provide a system prompt with instructions for how the model should process submission data (e.g., categorization, summarization, sentiment analysis, content generation). Specify the exact output format you need.

## Setup Instructions

### Configure the Integration

- Go to the [Integrations](../configuration/settings.mdx#integrations) section in Freeform Settings (**Freeform** → **Integrations**).
- Find _Gemini_ in the list of **service providers**.
- Copy and paste your API key into the integration in Freeform.
- Select the AI model you want to use. The default is `gemini-2.5-flash`.
  - When choosing a model, consider that AI processing can potentially hold up form submission processing for the user submitting the form, so try to choose a more light-weight model.
- Configure the max tokens, temperature, and cache settings. These can be overrided per form.
- Click the **Save** button.
