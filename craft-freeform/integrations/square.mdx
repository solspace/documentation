# Square<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" /><Badge type="addon" text="Coming Soon in 5.13!" />

Accepting payments on your site with Square is now supported. Setup is simpler than [Stripe](./stripe-payments.mdx), though Square offers fewer configuration options.

## Compatibility

- Supports one-time payments using Square's **Web Payments SDK** and REST API.
- Amounts are in the smallest currency unit (e.g. USD cents, so `500` is `$5.00`).

### How It Works

- Frontend: the Square Web Payments SDK creates a nonce and posts to a Freeform endpoint to create the payment.
- Backend: Freeform creates a Square payment and returns success/failure.
- Submission: After the form is saved, Freeform links the payment to the submission so it appears in the control panel.

    ### Complete the Connection

    - If you plan on testing the integration in sandbox mode (recommended), enable the **Use Sandbox** setting.
    - Click the **Save** button.
    - After the integration is saved, you should see an **Authorize** button at the top of the page.
    - Click **Authorize**.
    - If successful, the flag at the top will turn green and display _Authorized_.
