This integration allows you to use [xAI](https://x.ai)'s AI models for processing in form submissions.

Once you enable and configure an AI integration, the [AI field type](../forms/fields.mdx#ai) becomes available in your forms. Use it to provide a system prompt with instructions for how the model should process submission data (e.g., categorization, summarization, sentiment analysis, content generation). Specify the exact output format you need.

- Find _Gemini_ in the list of **service providers**.
- Copy and paste your API key into the integration in Freeform.
- Select the AI model you want to use. The default is `grok-3-mini`.
