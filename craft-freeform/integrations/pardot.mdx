### Prepare Pardot/Salesforce's end for Integration

- Open another browser tab and go to [Salesforce website](https://login.salesforce.com) and log into your account.
- On the left navigation menu, click on **Apps**, then click **App Manager**.
- At the top right corner of the page, click the **New Connected App** button.
- Fill out the fields in the **Basic Information** section.
- In the **API (Enable OAuth Settings)** section, click the **Enable OAuth Settings** checkbox.
- More fields will appear. In the **Callback URL** field, paste the value you copied from the **OAuth 2.0 Return URI** field inside Freeform.
- In the **Selected OAuth Scopes** field, select the following permissions from the list and click **Add** arrow button:
  - **Perform requests on your behalf at any time (refresh_token, offline_access)**
  - **Access Pardot services**
- You shouldn't need to fill out any further fields, and then click **Save** button.
- You will be taken to a new page that lists info about your newly created app, including **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret** values. You will need to copy each of these values.
  - Salesforce gets tricky to navigate, so do yourself a favor and copy and paste these 2 values into a text editor for now, being sure to label each too. You'll save yourself some extra steps later on.
- At the top middle of the page, click on the **Manage** button.
- At the top middle of the next page, click the **Edit Policies** button.
- Under the **OAuth policies** section, adjust the following settings:
  - In the **Permitted Users** field, be sure that it is set to **All users may self-authorize**.
  - In the **IP Relaxation** field, change the setting to **Relaxed IP restrictions**.
  - Click **Save** button at bottom of page.
- If you copy and pasted the **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret** values in a text editor, you can skip these next couple steps:
  - To go back to your app to see these values, click on the **App Manager** navigation item (under **Apps**)
  - Find your app in the list. Then in the right column, click the down arrow, and then click **View**.

### Prepare the Connection

  - Paste the Salesforce **Consumer Key** value into the **Client ID** field in Freeform.
  - Paste the Salesforce **Consumer Secret** value into the **Client Secret** field in Freeform.
- Enter your Pardot Business ID into the **Pardot Business Unit ID** field.
  - To find the Pardot Business Unit ID, go to _Marketing Setup_, in the _Quick Find_ box, enter `Pardot`, and then select _Pardot Account Setup_. Copy the business unit ID for the Pardot instance you want to use.
