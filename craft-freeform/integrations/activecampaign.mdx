# ActiveCampaign<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

:::info

Does your project require something else? &nbsp; <PrimaryButtonWithLink to='https://support.solspace.com/' label='Contact Us' />

### Fields

Maps data to the following field types:

- **Standard**

## Duplicate Check & Update

- Duplicate check on **Contact** (CRM & Email Marketing) email address (will update other details if it matches instead of creating a new contact).

#### CRM Notes

When setting up the form inside the form builder, please be sure to map all required fields for _Deal_:

- Currency, e.g. use a hidden field that contains `usd` or `eur`.
- Owner (ID), e.g. use a hidden field that contains `1`.
- Value ($ amount), e.g. use a hidden field that contains `500.00` or a regular input/select that allows the user to select the value, etc.

If you want the form submitter to automatically (or optionally) be opted into an ActiveCampaign mailing list, use a hidden field or dropdown, radioes, checkbox, etc that contains the ID of the mailing list you wish to have them subscribed to. Then map that field to the **Mailing List ID** field under _Contact_.

#### Email Marketing Notes

When mapping to **Contact Tags**, you can use any type of Freeform field you like, allowing for the most flexibility for all workflows. If you wish to have the user select their own tags, Freeform will automatically map over option value(s) from option fields such as checkboxes, dropdown fields, etc. If you wish to have tags forced upon submitters, you can include a Hidden or Invisible field type and include tag(s) in the value in the form builder.

When specifying multiples, separate each with a semi-colon (`;`), e.g. `basic;premium;premium plus;preferred`.
