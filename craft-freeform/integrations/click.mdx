Freeform's [POST Forwarding](../integrations/post-forwarding.mdx) feature allows you to integrate your forms with [Click](https://clickdimensions.com/) for Microsoft Dynamics.

This guide assumes you are familiar with [Click](https://clickdimensions.com/). We cannot provide any assistance with setting this up, aside from the basics.

## Setup Instructions

<VerticalStepWrapper>
  <StepMarkdown>
    ### Configure Post Forwarding integration

    - Go to the [Integrations](../configuration/settings.mdx#integrations) section in Freeform Settings (**Freeform** → **Integrations**).
    - Find _Post Forwarding_ in the list of **service providers**.
    - If you'd like POST Forwarding to be enabled for all forms by default, toggle on the **Enabled by default** setting.
    - Enter the default URL where the POST request should be sent to in the **URL** field. This can be overwritten per form inside the form builder.
    - Provide a default keyword or phrase Freeform should check for in the output of the external POST URL to know if and when there's an error to log, e.g. `error` or `an error occurred`, etc.
    - Save the page. This can be overwritten per form inside the form builder.

    ### Enable per Form inside the Builder
    To use this integration on your form(s), you'll need to configure each form individually. If you toggled on the **Enabled by default** setting in the Freeform Settings, it will automatically be ON for all forms. You can disable them for each form as necessary.

    - Visit the form inside the form builder.
    - Click on the **Integrations** tab.
    - Click on **POST Forwarding** in the list of available integrations.
    - On the right side of the page:
        - Enable (or disable) the integration.
        - Adjust any of the settings as needed.
    - Save the form.

    ### Add & Adjust Fields
    Include any additional fields as hidden fields inside Freeform, such as:

    - A field with handle `cd_visitorkey` and the key as the value.
    - A field with handle `form_friendly_id` and an applicable value, e.g. `ContactUs`.

    :::info
    Be sure to name/rename all Freeform field handles to match the _Click_ field names, e.g. `txtFirstName`, etc.

    ### Add Click Scripts
    In your template, add the _Click_ script, and then add this AFTER it:

    ```javascript
    var match = document.cookie.match(new RegExp('(^| )cuvid=([^;]+)'));
    if (match) {
      var cuvid = match[2];
      document.querySelector('input[name=cd_visitorkey]').value = cuvid;
    }
    ```
