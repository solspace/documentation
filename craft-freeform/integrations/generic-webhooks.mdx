# Generic Webhooks<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

Freeform's Generic Webhooks feature allows you to generate and POST the JSON from the Freeform submission data off to your own custom endpoint. It also contains a few form identifying entries.

This guide assumes you are familiar with what is necessary to connect Freeform data with a webhook from an external service, whether it's third party service or your own custom one, etc. For that matter, we cannot provide any assistance with setting this up, aside from the basics, and letting you know what kind of data to expect.

## Setup Instructions
