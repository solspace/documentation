</StepMarkdown>
<StepMarkdown>

### Create & get API Key from Pipedrive

- Click on the **Create an App** button at the top right and choose _Create Private App_.
- In the _Basic Info_ page, enter a unique app name and paste the Freeform OAuth URL in the **Callback URL** field.
- In the _OAuth & Access Scopes_ page, enable the following:
  - **Deals**
    - **Full Access**
  - **Contacts**
    - **Full Access**
  - **Leads**
    - **Full Access**
  - **Search for all data**
  - The **Installation URL** field can be left blank.

<StepMarkdown>

### Install the App on Production Pipedrive Account

:::info
If you wish to work with your app in Sandbox/Dev mode, you can skip this step for now.
:::

- Inside of the [Pipedrive Developer Hub](https://developers.pipedrive.com/) site, click on your newly created app and click the **Change to Live** button at the top right corner.
  :::warning
  In order for this to work, the site (and its callback URL) you are connecting the integration to will need to be publicly accessible.
  :::
- Visit your [regular Pipedrive account](https://pipedrive.com).
- In the **Marketplace** area, install your new app.

</StepMarkdown>
<StepMarkdown>

### Prepare the Connection

- Flip back to the Freeform CP browser tab.
- Enter Pipedrive credentials in the next 2 fields:
  - Paste the Pipedrive **Client ID** value into the **Client ID** field in Freeform.
  - Paste the Pipedrive **Client Secret** value into the **Client Secret** field in Freeform.

</StepMarkdown>
<StepMarkdown>

### Additional Configuration

#### Leads

If you plan to use the _Leads_ endpoint, the following setting is available:

- **User ID** (optional) - specify which user ID the leads go into.

:::info
There seems to be no visual way in Pipedrive to see what the ID's are, so you'll likely need to do something like right-clicking on a User name link to view the ID in a URL.
:::

<br />

#### Deals

If you plan to use the _Deals_ endpoint, the following settings are available:

- **User ID** (optional) - specify which user ID the leads go into.
- **Stage ID** (optional) - specify which stage ID the leads go into.

:::info
There seems to be no visual way in Pipedrive to see what the ID's are, so you'll likely need to do something like right-clicking on a Stage name / User name link to view the ID in a URL. So for example, to get the Stage ID, go to the **Settings** area and click on **Pipelines**. Right-click on a stage name and copy the link. You'll get something like (where `3` is the stage ID in this case):

`https://yourcompany.pipedrive.com/stages/edit/3.json`

The stage ID is unique, so Pipedrive will automatically know which pipeline you're referring to when you specify the stage ID.

- Click the **Save** button.
- You will be redirected to a Pipedrive OAuth page to allow permissions.
  - If not currently logged in, fill in your credentials.
  - Click **Allow & Install** when asked for permissions.
- You will then be redirected back to the **Freeform CRM Integration** page.

</StepMarkdown>
<StepMarkdown>

### Verify Authorization

- After the integration is saved, it'll return you to the list of CRM integrations.
- Click into the newly created integration.
- Confirm that there is green circle with **Authorized** in the middle of the page.

</StepMarkdown>
<StepMarkdown>

### Configure the Form

To use this integration on your form(s), you'll need to configure each form individually.

- Visit the form inside the form builder.
- Click on the **Integrations** tab.
- Click on **Pipedrive** in the list of available integrations.
- On the right side of the page:
  - Enable the integration.
  - Select the API endpoints you wish to map to.
  - Map Freeform fields to the Pipedrive fields as needed.

</StepMarkdown>
</VerticalStepWrapper>

:::warning
Please note that if you set this up initially on a development environment, you will need to update your callback URL and reauthorize the connection on your production environment. However, your settings and field mappings will remain intact.
