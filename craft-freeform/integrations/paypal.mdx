# PayPal<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" /><Badge type="addon" text="Coming Soon in 5.13!" />

Accepting payments on your site with PayPal is now supported. Setup is simpler than [Stripe](./stripe-payments.mdx), though PayPal offers fewer configuration options.

#### Payment Flow

1. The customer fills out the form and selects either the **PayPal** or **Debit or Credit Card** button.
2. If **PayPal** is selected, a popup appears where the customer can log into their PayPal account and pay using PayPal funds or linked accounts.
3. Once payment is complete, the popup closes and the customer is returned to the Freeform form. They must then click the **Submit** button to finalize the form submission.

## Compatibility

Uses a private app on `v1` of the REST API.

### Endpoints

Maps data to PayPal with the **Popup Payment Flow** via the **Orders** endpoint.

## Sandbox Testing

### Testing PayPal button

Testing the **PayPal** button will require that you have a test PayPal account configured so you can log into it.

Go to the [PayPal Developer area](https://developer.paypal.com). Click on **Testing Tools** and then **Sandbox Accounts**.

- This will be used for PayPal testing on your site.

Switch back to your Craft site and open your form on the front end.

- Click the **PayPal** button. A popup will load.
- Log into PayPal with the **Personal** test account credentials you copied earlier.
- Complete the transaction.

### Testing Debit or Credit Card button

Testing **Debit or Credit Card** button is a little more straight-forward.

- Click the **Debit or Credit Card** button. A series of form fields will load directly on the page.
- Use PayPal's [credit card generator](https://developer.paypal.com/tools/sandbox/card-testing/#link-testcardnumbers) to create test credit card details.
- Complete the transaction.
