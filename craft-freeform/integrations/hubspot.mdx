# HubSpot<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" /><Badge type="feature" text="Improved in 5.0+" />

This guide assumes you have a [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com) account already.

:::warning
Please note this is a complete integration between Freeform and HubSpot and should NOT be used along with [HubSpot's "Collected Forms" javascript-based feature](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/forms/use-non-hubspot-forms). Otherwise, you may observe unintended behavior.
:::

## Compatibility

Uses private app on `v3` of the REST API.

### Endpoints

Maps data to the following endpoints:

- **Deals**
- **Contacts**
- **Companies**

Does your project require something else? &nbsp; <PrimaryButtonWithLink to='/support' label='Contact Us' />

### Tracking<Badge type="feature" text="New in 5.6+" />

Automatically supports the **[HubSpot tracking code](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/reports/install-the-hubspot-tracking-code)** if present.

### Fields

Maps data to the following field types (of text/number string type only):

- **Standard**
- **Custom**

## Duplicate Check & Update

A duplicate check on records is done in the following way:

1. Check whether the _Contact_ already exists:
   - Check against **Email address** as the identifier.
   - If there's a match, update the _Contact_ with new values, where supplied.
   - If no match, create a new HubSpot _Contact_.
2. Check whether the _Company_ already exists:
   - Check against **Company domain name**, which is automatically generated by HubSpot from the _Contact_ email address domain name.
   - If there's a match, update the _Company_ with new values, where supplied.
   - If no match, create a new HubSpot _Company_.
   - If a new _Contact_ was created, link the contact to the _Company_.
3. Create new _Deal_.
   - Attach the _Deal_ to existing or newly created HubSpot _Company_ and _Contact_.
