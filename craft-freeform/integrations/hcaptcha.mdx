# hCaptcha Integration<Badge type="feature" text="Improved in 5.0+" />

Freeform includes an integration for [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/). Check out the options below.

## Overview

All **hCaptcha** offerings will be automatically loaded and handled by Freeform (when enabled for the form). The **hCaptcha Checkbox** field will be automatically inserted above the Submit button(s).

Each _hCaptcha_ integration is managed inside the _Captchas_ area under Settings and then further configurable per form inside the form builder. Every integration is a little bit different, so please follow the detailed instructions for setting up the integration below.

## Supported Types

Below is a list of the _hCaptcha_ integrations supported by Freeform and how each of them work.

### hCaptcha Checkbox<BadgeGroup><Badge type="lite" text="Lite" /><Badge type="pro" text="Pro" /></BadgeGroup>

This is based off of _reCAPTCHA_ and works very similarly. All users submitting your form must check off the hCaptcha checkbox, and in some cases, users will be presented the puzzle to solve to submit the form successfully.

### hCaptcha Invisible<BadgeGroup><Badge type="lite" text="Lite" /><Badge type="pro" text="Pro" /></BadgeGroup>

Most users will not even know it's automatically validating them, but like the hCaptcha Checkbox described above, some users will be presented a modal on the page with the puzzle to solve when they click the submit button.

## Setup Instructions

:::warning
In order for this to work, the site you are connecting the integration to will need to be publicly accessible.

    }
}) }}
