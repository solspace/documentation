# AI Spam Analysis<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" /><Badge type="feature" text="New in 5.12+" />

**AI Spam Analysis** uses your configured [AI integration](../#ai) to evaluate each submission and decide whether it's spam. CAPTCHAs often miss human-entered spam. This feature lets you provide a customizable prompt with clear rules (what to flag, what to allow), and Freeform applies it to the submitted data.

If a submission is flagged, the **Spam Reason** appears on the Submission detail page in the control panel, explaining why it was classified as spam.

:::info
This feature requires you to have your own **AI** service and API key that is configured and connected through a Freeform [AI integration](../#ai).
