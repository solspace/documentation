### Set up Integration on your site

- Go to the [Email Marketing section in Freeform Settings](../configuration/settings.mdx#email-marketing) (**Freeform → Settings → Email Marketing**).
- Click the **New Integration** button at the top right.
- Select _Dotdigital (v2)_ from the **Service Provider** select dropdown.
- Enter a name and handle for the integration.
- Paste the Dotdigital API connector email address into the **API User Email** field in Freeform.
- Enter the chosen password for that API user in the **API User Password** field in Freeform.
- Configure additional settings:

  - **Email Opt In Type** - choose one of the following:

    - _Single_
    - _Double_
    - _Verified Double_
      :::info
      Setting this to _Verified Double_ will result in a double opt-in confirmation email sent to the contact. The result will state that the contact's Opt-In Type is _Double_ and the Status is _Pending Opt-In_. These will only update to _Verified Double_ and _Subscribed_, respectively, once the contact has clicked the link in the confirmation email, at which point they will be added to the account.

      It is possible to update an existing contact using this operation. A duplicate contact will _not_ be created. If the contact already exists, then any data provided in your request that is already held for the contact will be overwritten and updated in the system.
      :::

  - **Email Type** - choose one of the following:
    - _Plain Text_
    - _HTML_

- Click the **Save** button.
