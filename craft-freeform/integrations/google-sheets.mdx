### Prepare the Connection

- Flip back to the Freeform CP browser tab.
- Paste the Google Sheets **Client ID** value into the **Client ID** field in Freeform.
- Paste the Google Sheets **Client Secret** value into the **Client Secret** field in Freeform.
- Additional settings to set the defaults for forms:
  - **Process User-inputted Formulas and Formats**
    - Any user-inputted values with formula and formatting syntax will be respected and parsed in the spreadsheet. When disabled, these values will be escaped.
  - **Row Insert Behavior**
    - Choose how new data rows should be inserted into the Google Sheet. **Insert New Row** will add a new row to the spreadsheet directly before the first empty row. **Replace Next Empty Row** will find the first empty row and write the new content into it. Neither option will overwrite existing data.

### Finish the Connection
