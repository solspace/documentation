Freeform's Generic Webhooks feature allows you to generate and POST the JSON from the Freeform submission data off to your own custom endpoint. It also contains a few form identifying entries.

This guide assumes you have a [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com) account already.

## Compatibility

Uses OAuth flow on `v4` of the REST API.

### Endpoints

Maps data to spreadsheets via the **Google Sheets API**.

### Fields

- Under the **Scopes** section, click on the _Add or Remove Scopes_ button.
  - Find `auth/spreadsheets` in the list, or manually add it...
    - To manually add, enter `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets` in **Manually Add Scopes** setting.
    - Click _Save and continue_ button.

### Prepare the Connection

- Flip back to the Freeform CP browser tab.
- Paste the Google Sheets **Client ID** value into the **Client ID** field in Freeform.
- Paste the Google Sheets **Client Secret** value into the **Client Secret** field in Freeform.
- Additional settings to set the defaults for forms:
  - **Process User-inputted Formulas and Formats**
    - Any user-inputted values with formula and formatting syntax will be respected and parsed in the spreadsheet. When disabled, these values will be escaped.
  - **Row Insert Behavior**
    - Choose how new data rows should be inserted into the Google Sheet. **Insert New Row** will add a new row to the spreadsheet directly before the first empty row. **Replace Next Empty Row** will find the first empty row and write the new content into it. Neither option will overwrite existing data.

### Finish the Connection

- Click the **Save** button.
- You will be redirected to a Google OAuth page to allow permissions.
  - If not currently logged in, fill in your credentials.

    - Enter the number of rows to skip from the beginning of the sheet. Input `0` to start from the first row, or `3` to skip the first 3 rows, and so on.

    - Any user-inputted values with formula and formatting syntax will be respected and parsed in the spreadsheet. When disabled, these values will be escaped.
  - **Row Insert Behavior**
