# Google Tag Manager

Freeform includes built-in support for [Google Tag Manager](https://tagmanager.google.com/) if you wish to use that with your forms.

This guide assumes you are familiar with [Google Tag Manager](https://tagmanager.google.com/). We cannot provide any assistance with setting this up, aside from the basics.

## Setup Instructions

<VerticalStepWrapper>
<StepMarkdown>
### Enable Google Tag Manager inside Freeform
- Go to the ['Single' integration section in Freeform Settings](../configuration/settings.mdx#email-marketing) (**Freeform → Settings → Integrations → Single**).
- Click on **Google Tag Manager** in the list.
- Enable it by toggling on the **Enabled** setting.
- If you'd like GTM to be enabled for all forms by default, toggle on the **Enabled by default** setting.
- If you wish to have Freeform insert its own scripts, enter your GTM ID (`GTM-XXXXXX`) in the **Container ID** setting and a custom event name (if applicable) in the **Event Name** setting.
- Save the form.

### Configure the Form

To use this integration on your form(s), you'll need to configure each form individually. If you toggled on the **Enabled by default** setting in the Freeform Settings, it will automatically be ON for all forms. You can disable them for each form as necessary.

- Visit the form inside the form builder.
- Click on the **Integrations** tab.
- Click on **Google Tag Manager** in the list of available integrations.
- On the right side of the page:
  - Enable (or disable) the integration.
  - Adjust any of the settings as needed.
- Save the form.

### Customizing

To customise what gets sent to the events, you can write your own JS and add an event listener in your template, like this:

```js showLineNumbers
window.addEventListener('freeform-gtm-data-layer-push', function (event) {
  event.payload.myCustomValue = 'something_here';
  event.payload.otherCustomValue = 'other_value';
});
```

This would then attach whatever you add to the payload to the event that is being pushed to GTM.

### Submit a Test Submission

- Visit your form on your site.
- Fill out the form and submit it.
- The data should have been pushed to GTM using the specified event name.

:::info
The success of this is not observable on your site, as this event goes to GTM via some sockets, so there's nothing in the network tab.

### Check Google Tag Manager

To see if your test worked correctly, visit the [Google Tag Manager](https://tagmanager.google.com/) website and open your project workspace. Then click on the **PREVIEW** button near the top right side of the page.

### Troubleshooting

Google offers a [Tag Assistant](https://tagassistant.google.com/) tool along with a [Tag Assistant Companion](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tag-assistant-companion/jmekfmbnaedfebfnmakmokmlfpblbfdm) Chrome extension. These help troubleshoot installation of `gtag.js` and **Google Tag Manager**. When the Chrome extension is present, it enables additional features for Tag Assistant including debugging iframes and debugging multiple windows from the same debug session.
