# Mollie<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" /><Badge type="addon" text="Coming Soon in 5.13!" />

Accepting payments on your site with Mollie is now supported. Setup is simpler than [Stripe](./stripe-payments.mdx), though Mollie offers fewer configuration options.

## Compatibility

- Uses Mollie Payments on `v2` of the REST API.
- Supports one-time payments.
- A publicly accessible site is required to fully test or use Mollie.

### How It Works

- Frontend: no _Mollie_ field is presented to the user when viewing the form. When the user submits the form, the page redirects to a Mollie-hosted page to accept the payment.
- Backend: Freeform creates a Mollie payment and returns the user to the configured success/failure URL.
- Submission: After the payment is completed and the form submission is saved, Freeform links the payment to the submission so it appears in the control panel.
