:::info
For mapping to Provinces or States, you'll map to the **Region** field. The **Region** field expects values like `US-CA` for California state in USA, or `CA-MB` for Manitoba province in Canada. When mapping to Regions, it's required you map the Country code as well.

Country code mapping uses 3-digit codes like `USA` for United States of America, `CAN` for Canada, `GBR` for United Kingdom, etc.

:::warning
Please note that if you set this up initially on a development environment, you will need to update your callback URL and reauthorize the connection on your production environment. However, your settings and field mappings will remain intact.
