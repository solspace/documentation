# reCAPTCHA<Badge type="feature" text="Improved in 5.0+" />

Freeform includes an integration for Google [reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/). The options below are compatible with the Enterprise API and the Classic legacy keys.

## Overview

All **reCAPTCHA** offerings will be automatically loaded and handled by Freeform (when enabled for the form). The **reCAPTCHA v2 Checkbox** field will be automatically inserted above the Submit button(s).

Each _reCAPTCHA_ integration is managed inside the _Captchas_ area under Settings and then further configurable per form inside the form builder. Every integration is a little bit different, so please follow the detailed instructions for setting up the integration below.

## Supported Types

Below is a list of the _reCAPTCHA_ integrations supported by Freeform and how each of them work. These are each compatible with the Enterprise API and the Classic legacy keys.

### reCAPTCHA v2 Checkbox

All users submitting your form must check off the reCAPTCHA checkbox, and in some cases, users will be presented the puzzle to solve to submit the form successfully. This is available in all editions of Freeform.

### Challenge - Invisible (v2)<Badge type="lite" text="Lite" /><Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

Most users will not even know it's automatically validating them, but like the Challenge Checkbox (v2) described above, some users will be presented a modal on the page with the puzzle to solve when they click the submit button.

### Score Based (v3)<Badge type="lite" text="Lite" /><Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

Users are never presented any puzzle to solve, etc. Instead, users are automatically validated by Google based on a score assigned to them. You have control over that score threshold inside Freeform settings. We suggest starting with something like `0.5` and see how that goes (where a `0.0` score means that it's almost certain a bot and a `1.0` score means it's a user). If the user does not pass this threshold, the submission will follow the behavior you set out for it in the settings (send to spam folder / reject it entirely / show an error to the user, etc). The user has no ability to validate themselves like in **Challenge (v2)** reCAPTCHAs.

## Behavior & Overrides

The following options are available for adjusting the behavior of _reCAPTCHA_ and overriding at the template-level.

### Only load Captcha scripts once the user interacts with the form

If you'd like to have the associated Captcha scripts load only once a user begins filling out the form, enable the corresponding setting inside the **Captchas** settings page. If you'd like your forms to be ready to go at page load, disable this setting.

### Disabling Captchas

To disable Captchas per form at template level, add the `disableCaptcha: true` parameter to the [Form query](../templates/queries/form.mdx).

### Manual Placement<Badge type="feature" text="New in 5.7+" />

If you need full control over the placement of the visible _reCAPTCHA v2 Checkbox_, please see the [Captcha Placement](../templates/formatting/index.mdx#captcha-placement-) guide.

### Add Attributes to Wrapper <Badge type="feature" text="New in 5.1+" />

You can add attributes to the main Captcha wrapper that is automatically inserted by Freeform.

<CodeTabs>
<TabItems>
<CodeTabItem filetype="twig" value="index" label="index.twig" default>
```twig showLineNumbers
{{ form.render({
    captchas: {
        class: ["custom-class", "another-class"],
        "data-test": true,
    }
}) }}
```
</CodeTabItem>

<CodeTabItem filetype="html" value="index" label="output" default>
```twig showLineNumbers
// Output (truncated for example)
...
<div class="custom-class another-class" data-test data-freeform-recaptcha-container>
    <div class="g-recaptcha">
...
```
</CodeTabItem>

</TabItems>
</CodeTabs>

### Load reCAPTCHA JS Manually

If you're loading an entire form via AJAX, you'll need to load the reCAPTCHA JS yourself, since it's considered insecure otherwise and the browser blocks it. You should add this script tag anywhere on your page, preferably the footer:

```html showLineNumbers
<script
  type="text/javascript"
  src="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js?render=explicit"
></script>
```

### Set the Action for Score Based (v3)

To set the action of Score Based (v3), add `recaptchaAction: "myaction"` to your `form.renderTag`, like this:

```twig showLineNumbers
{{ form.renderTag({ recaptchaAction: "myaction" }) }}
```

### Hiding the reCAPTCHA floating badge

_Challenge - Invisible (v2)_ and _Score Based (v3)_ will automatically load a reCAPTCHA icon in the bottom right corner of your site containing the form. This is required by Google's terms of service. There are CSS workarounds if you wish to locate the icon to the left side of the browser page, etc.

If you'd like to hide the reCAPTCHA floating badge (bottom right for _v2 Invisible_ and _v3_), you are allowed to do so as along as you provide reference to reCAPTCHA in the user flow. Quote and example from the [Google reCAPTCHA docs](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/faq#id-like-to-hide-the-recaptcha-badge.-what-is-allowed):

> You are allowed to hide the badge as long as you include the reCAPTCHA branding visibly in the user flow. Please include the following text:
>
> ```twig showLineNumbers
> This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google
> <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms">Terms of Service</a> apply.
> ```
>
> Note: if you choose to hide the badge, please use:
>
> ```twig
> .grecaptcha-badge { visibility: hidden; }
> ```
