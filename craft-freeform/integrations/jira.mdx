This guide assumes you have a [Jira / Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) account already.

## Compatibility

Uses OAuth flow on `v3` of the REST API.

### Endpoints
Maps data to Jira **Cards**. Works for _Software_ and _Business_ project types.

:::warning
Please note that because of the complexity of the Jira integration, you need to create a separate Jira integration for each additional Jira project you want to map.
