To use this integration on your form(s), you'll need to configure each form individually.

- Visit the form inside the form builder.
- Click on the **Integrations** tab.
- Click on **Mailchimp** in the list of available integrations.
- On the right side of the page:
  - Enable the integration.
  - Choose a Freeform field to be the target opt-in field.

  - Map Freeform fields to the Mailchimp fields as you wish.

</StepMarkdown>
</VerticalStepWrapper>

## Additional Features

### Contact Tags

To map _Contact Tags_, in the **Contact Tags** field mapping area in the form builder for the form, select a Freeform field that will contain Tag value(s). This could be a select dropdown, checkboxes, radios, hidden field, etc. When specifying multiples, separate by comma.

- By default, the Mailchimp integration will replace/overwrite any existing Contact Tags if it finds an existing contact for the email address in Mailchimp. If you'd like it to append/add to the existing Contact Tags instead, enable the **Append Mailchimp Contact Tags on update instead of overwriting?** setting inside the integration settings.

### Contact Groups

To map a _Contact Interest/Group_, in the **Contact Groups** field mapping area in the form builder for the form, select a Freeform field that will contain an Interest/Group name value(s). This could be a select dropdown, a checkboxes, radios, hidden field, etc.

- Values are case-sensitive and should be entered exactly as it is in Mailchimp, e.g. `My Group Name`.
- It can accept more than one group.

### Marketing Permissions

To map _GDPR consent / Marketing settings_ options, in the **Marketing Permissions** field mapping area in the form builder for the form, select the Freeform field(s) which will represent opting into the corresponding options. ANY value included in these will be considered an opt-in (regardless of whether it's `yes` or `y`, etc). You will need to map a field to each setting individually, so you'll likely need to use a separate checkbox field for each.

:::warning
Please note that if you set this up initially on a development environment, you will need to update your callback URL and reauthorize the connection on your production environment. However, your settings and field mappings will remain intact.
