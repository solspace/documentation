:::warning
Due to the nature of this update we recommend anyone upgrading from Freeform 4.x to do so carefully in a development environment and follow the special instructions below.
:::

## Key Changes

The Freeform 5.0 update is a major overhaul to the structure, templating, and form builder organization. There are many breaking changes that will allow us to continue to improve Freeform in the future. Please note all key changes below:

Fields can be cloned or reused, however, as the form builder allows you to pull in fields from other forms or save common fields as Favorites.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | **No action is necessary.** The migration from Freeform 4 will respect the new architecture and recreate all fields into each form. If you do have a need for a set of common fields, e.g. **First Name**, **Last Name**, **Email Address**, you could open up a form in the form builder and save any number of these as a Favorite.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| **Freeform Honeypot / Javascript Test**<span class="change-affects-text">Affects: **Most**</span><div class="change-affects"><div class="change-affects-bar affects-most"></div></div> | The **Freeform Honeypot** offers basic protection against forms. The **Javascript Test** enhances the Honeypot test by performing an action to it that requires javascript to be enabled in the browser.                                                                                               | The **Freeform Honeypot** and **Javascript Test** features have been decoupled, overhauled, and set up as integrations. They can now be enabled/disabled and configured per form. The Javascript Test is now a simpler approach that will streamline use with caching or headless implementations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | If you wish to use/continue to use the **Honeypot** and/or **Javascript Test** feature, please enable them inside the _Integrations_ area of the Freeform settings. If you're using these features with caching, please [review the Caching documentation](../guides/templating/caching-forms.mdx) to update your template code as necessary. If you're using a headless approach, please [review the GraphQL documentation](../headless/graphql.mdx) to update as necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

This approach also allows for easy toggling on/off integrations, so it will be easier to have different ones configured per environment, e.g. Production, Development. Many CRM and Email Marketing integrations now use OAuth for better security as well.                                                                                                                                   | The migration from Freeform 4 will **NOT** carry forward any integrations.

The **Bootstrap 3**, **Bootstrap 4**, **Bootstrap 5 Multipage All Fields** and **Tailwind 1** formatting templates have been removed. A basic **Multipage All Fields** formatting template now replaces the **Bootstrap 5 Multipage All Fields** template. If you're using any of the sample formatting templates, the migration will attempt to update the formatting template to the closest available one, e.g. **Tailwind 1** → **Tailwind 3**, **Bootstrap 4** → **Bootstrap 5**, etc. All sample formatting templates have been revised, however, so you should review how each one displays within your site and adjust CSS, etc as necessary. |

E.g.

## Updating from 3.x

While updating from Freeform 3.x directly to 5.x is possible, we strongly recommend the following additional steps to help the process go smoother...

:::danger
Be sure to back up your site files and database before proceeding.
:::

<VerticalStepWrapper>
<StepMarkdown>
Update to the latest 3.x version of Freeform (`3.13.x`). Be sure to run any available migrations.

</StepMarkdown>
<StepMarkdown>
Update to the latest 4.x version of Freeform (4.1.x) and Craft 4.x. Run any available migrations and confirm that everything appears to work correctly.

</StepMarkdown>
<StepMarkdown>
Proceed to the Updating from 4.x guide below...

### Review Changes

Carefully review the [changelog](./changelog.mdx) for Freeform 5.x as well as the new [key features/changes](#key-changes) table above.

</StepMarkdown>
<StepMarkdown>

### Update `composer.json` File

Edit your project's `composer.json` file and update the Freeform version to 5.x:

```diff
  "require": {
      "craftcms/cms": "^5.0.0",
      "vlucas/phpdotenv": "^5.4.0",
-     "solspace/craft-freeform": "^4.0.0",
+     "solspace/craft-freeform": "^5.0.0",
      "solspace/craft-calendar": "^5.0.0"
  },
```

</StepMarkdown>
<StepMarkdown>

### Get Latest 5.x Package

Get the latest 5.x package of Freeform by running the following command:

```sh
php craft update freeform
```

To get a specific version, run the following command:
```sh
php craft update freeform:5.7.0
```

</StepMarkdown>
<StepMarkdown>

### Perform Migration

In your CLI, run one of the following commands:

#### Update all plugins including Craft

```sh
php craft migrate/all
```

#### Update Freeform only

```sh
php craft migrate --plugin=freeform
```

:::warning
We strongly advise against using the Control Panel for updates and migrations. Sites with numerous forms, fields, and submission data may encounter issues using this method.
:::

</StepMarkdown>
<StepMarkdown>

### Testing and Cleanup

There will almost certainly be some amount of cleanup required for every site.

- Be sure to apply any changes noted in the [key features/changes](#key-changes) table above.
- Carefully review and update all Freeform settings, submission data and forms in the form builder.
- Also be sure to review and update your templates and formatting templates (if you have any custom ones) and ensure that everything works correctly and any necessary updates are made.
- If you plan to use the demo templates to review/text/experiment, please reinstall them if you already installed then in an earlier version of Freeform.

### Migrate Craft 4 Element Titles

If you have upgraded your Craft 4 site to Craft 5, please note that the Craft migration process does not automatically migrate submission Element titles. In Craft 5, Element titles are now stored in the `elements_sites` table, and the `content` table which used to store Element titles is no longer used.

While most plugins could include a separate migration script to handle this, Freeform 5 supports both Craft 4 and Craft 5, making this path impossible. Instead, a CLI command has been included that needs to be executed once after upgrading from Craft 4 to Craft 5.

:::warning
This CLI command is only applicable to sites that have migrated from Craft 4 to Craft 5 while Freeform was installed.
:::

```sh
php craft freeform/submissions/fix-titles
```
