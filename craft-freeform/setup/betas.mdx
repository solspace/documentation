# Beta Testing

As part of our commitment to developing and releasing reliable and stable software, we thoroughly beta test all major and minor feature releases.

:::info
Freeform 5 is now available!
:::

## Current Beta

<h3 class="yellow">Stay tuned for the next Freeform beta!</h3>

If you wish to join this beta, please follow the instructions and guide below.

:::danger
While we carefully develop new features and put all of them through rigorous alpha and beta testing, we cannot guarantee that there will be no major issues in beta software. It's also possible that specific edge case scenarios may have been missed, etc. For this reason, we strongly advise you <u>**not**</u> to use the current beta version in production environments.
:::

## Providing Feedback

We would greatly appreciate it if you are able to provide us with routine feedback throughout your testing and usage of the beta. Even if you aren't using any of the new features or changes, providing feedback allows us to get a better idea of how things are going for all kinds of websites.

To make this even easier, we've included a Beta Feedback widget that displays in the Freeform control panel. Just click a star rating (_5/5_ to indicate if everything is going well, or less if you are experiencing any issues) and if you have anything to clarify, fill in a quick note in the text area and click submit. You can optionally include your email address, which will also help us get in touch with you to get more information about any issues and/or assist you as necessary.

Feel free to also just use a [Private Support Ticket](/support/) or report an issue via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/solspace/craft-freeform/issues).

:::info
**This widget will only display during betas.** If you wish to disable it from displaying, add `FREEFORM_DISABLE_BETA_FEEDBACK_WIDGET=1` to your `.ENV` file.
