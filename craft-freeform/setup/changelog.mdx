### Changed
- Changed spam blocking to be integrations now. Previously, whenever `allowAdminChanges` was set to `false`, it was no longer possible for users to modify blocked keywords, emails and IP addresses.

    - Removed Blocked Keywords, Emails, and IP Addresses from the Spam Protection settings area.

    - Added a migration that migrates previous settings into new integrations and applies them to existing forms.

## 5.3.0<TitleDate date="2024-05-24" />

### Changed
- Improved the Script Insert feature:
    The _Static URLs_ option is no longer available, and the default is now Craft's _Asset Bundles_ (an improved version of _As Files_). This ensures the best performance and reliability for any site and compatibility with Craft Cloud.

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where the Express Forms migration was not working as of Freeform 5.1.19+.

## 5.2.0<TitleDate date="2024-05-15" />

### Added
- Added optional **Site Filtering** setting for forms and submissions (Pro). This setting allows you to filter form lists by Sites and prevents other admins from accessing forms that belong to Sites they don't have access to.
