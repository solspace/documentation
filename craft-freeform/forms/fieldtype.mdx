# _Form_ Element Field Type<BadgeGroup><Badge type="lite" text="Lite" /><Badge type="pro" text="Pro" /></BadgeGroup>

Freeform includes a _Freeform Form_ field type (and [Freeform Submissions](../submissions/fieldtype.mdx)), which allows you to assign/relate forms to other element types such as Craft Entries.

## Overview

The Freeform Form field type allows you to assign/relate forms to other element types such as Craft Entries. A common use case here would be if you wanted to allow admins to attach a specific Freeform form to a Craft Entry that corresponds to the entry, and then automate loading the form along with the entry in the front end templates.

### Creating the Field

Creating a Freeform Form field is done just like any other fieldtype, here's an overview of the process:

Click the **New field** button in the top right corner.

<VerticalStepWrapper>
<StepMarkdown>
Go to the **Settings** area in Craft control panel. Click on **Fields**.

Click the **New field** button in the top right corner.

</StepMarkdown>
<StepMarkdown>
Name the field as you wish. For example: *Related Form* with a handle of `relatedForm`.
</StepMarkdown>
<StepMarkdown>

For the **Field Type** option, select _Freeform Form_ from the list.

**Selection Label** is the text that will appear on the button which opens the Freeform Form selection pop-up dialog.

</StepMarkdown>
<StepMarkdown>
Click the **Save** button in the top right corner to save the new field.

</StepMarkdown>
</VerticalStepWrapper>

Your Freeform Form field is now available to be assigned to other sections.

### Template Properties

The following template properties are available for the _Form_ field type:

- `name` - outputs the name of the form
- `handle` - outputs the handle of the form
- `id` - outputs the unique ID of the form
- `description` - outputs the description of the form
- `render()` - outputs the full form, rendering it with the [Formatting Template](../templates/formatting/index.mdx) specified in the form builder for the form.

### Usage in Elements<Badge type="feature" text="New in 5.7.2+" />

A **Usage in Elements** tab is available inside of each form's **Settings** tab in the form builder. It displays a list of other Craft elements that use that form in the Freeform Form element field type (Craft 5 only).

## Examples

### Freeform Form Field in Entries

An example of template code you would use to display a Freeform form (with field handle of _myFreeformFieldName_) that is attached to a Craft Entry would look something like this:

```twig {5-8} showLineNumbers
{% for entry in craft.entries.section('news').limit(10) %}
    <div class="entry">
        <h2><a href="{{ entry.url }}">{{ entry.title }}</a></h2>
        {{ entry.summary }}
        {% if entry.myFreeformFieldName is defined and entry.myFreeformFieldName is not empty %}
            <h3>{{ entry.myFreeformFieldName.name }}</h3>
            {{ entry.myFreeformFieldName.render() }}
        {% endif %}
    </div>
{% endfor %}
```

### Freeform Form Field in Matrix field

If you're using the _Freeform Form_ field inside a Matrix field, your code might look something like this:

```twig {6-7} showLineNumbers
<div class="entry">
    <h1>{{ entry.title }}</h1>
    {{ entry.body }}
    {% for block in entry.myMatrixField.all() %}
        {% if block.type == "form" %}
            <h3>{{ block.myFreeformFieldName.name }}</h3>
            {{ block.myFreeformFieldName.render }}
            <p>{{ block.someOtherField }}</p>
        {% elseif block.type == "whatever" %}
            <p>Whatever</p>
        {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
</div>
```

### Passing Entry Data into Freeform Fields

If you'd like to automatically pass content from another element (such as a Craft Entry) into Freeform field(s), you'd have to use the `value` parameter as part of the [Template Overrides](../templates/formatting/index.mdx#template-overrides) feature inside your formatting template.

For example, if you want to pass the title of an entry to a Freeform field, and the entry slug is in the second segment of your URL, you should set that in your formatting template. Also, be sure to include a hidden Freeform field in your form (in this case called `entryTitle`). Your template code might look something like this:

```twig showLineNumbers
{% set entry = craft.entries.slug(craft.app.request.getSegment(2)).one() %}

{{ form.renderTag({
    fields: {
        "entryTitle": {
            value: entry.title
        },
    }
}) }}

```
