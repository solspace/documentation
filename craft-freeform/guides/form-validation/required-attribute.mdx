# Browser Validation with Required Attribute

A guide to browser validation on fields using the `required` attribute. If you prefer to have the browser validate that a required field contains a value, there is an automated way to do this with the [Template Overides](../../templates/formatting/index.mdx#template-overrides) feature.

## Instructions

In previous versions of Freeform, there was a parameter to control this (`useRequiredAttribute`), but that is no longer available.

To apply a `required` attribute to all fields that are marked as required in the form builder, you can access it with `":required"` via the `fields` namespace in the [Template Overides](../../templates/formatting/index.mdx#template-overrides) feature.

A barebones example (without any other overrides in place) would look something like this:

```twig showLineNumbers {3-8}
{{ form.render({
    fields: {
        ":required": {
            attributes: {
                label: { "+class": "label-required" },
                input: { "required": true },
            },
        },
    }
}) }}
```
