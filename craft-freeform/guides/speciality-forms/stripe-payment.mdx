# Creating Stripe Payment Forms<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

Freeform allows you to easily create complex payment forms using its own built-in [Stripe Payments](../../integrations/stripe-payments.mdx) integration.



## Instructions

:::info
This feature requires the **Freeform Pro** edition and a [Stripe](https://stripe.com) account in order to work.

### Set up the basics for the form

- Create a new form or open an existing one.
- Add fields for all of the information you'd like to collect, e.g. _Name_, _Email_, etc.
- Create a [Radios](../../forms/fields.mdx#radios) or [Dropdown](../../forms/fields.mdx#dropdown) field named **Amount** with all of the necessary predefined options (e.g. `100`, `50`, `20`, etc) and add a final option of `Other`.
- Create a [Number](../../forms/fields.mdx#number) field named **Other** and place it below or beside the _Amount_ field you just created.
- Create a [Calculation](../../forms/fields.mdx#calculation) field named **Calculated Amount** and set its visibility to be `Hidden`.
- Create a second page for your form (let's name page 1 as **Details** and page 2 as **Payment**).
- In the **Payment** page (page 2), create and place a [Stripe](../../forms/fields.mdx#stripe) field named **Payment Details**.

### Set up conditional rules

- Go to the **Rules** tab of the form.
- Click on the **Other** (Number) field to add a rule.
- Set it to show only when the Radio field has the "Other" option selected.

### Configure the Stripe integration

- Click on the **Integrations** tab in the form builder.
- Find your _User_ element integration in the list on the left and click on it.
- Toggle ON the **Enabled** setting.
- The default settings will show. If you need to override any of these, you can do so here:
  - **User Group** - select the user group to assign new users to.



In the Stripe Payment field's settings (in the Layout tab), select "Dynamic" for "Payment Amount Type".
In the Payment Amount Field, select the Calculation field.
Configure the rest of the Stripe field as necessary.



Once that's all finished, you'll have something that looks like the screenshots above. Check out your form in the Freeform demo templates and see if everything works correctly.
