# Creating a Donation Payment form<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

Freeform allows you to easily create complex payment forms using its own built-in [Stripe Payments](../../integrations/stripe-payments.mdx) integration. While a wide variety of options are available, the following guide will show you how to make a one-time Donation page that allows your users to choose from a few predefined amounts or enter their own amount.

:::info
This feature requires the **Freeform Pro** edition and a [Stripe](https://stripe.com) account in order to work.

## Instructions

<StepMarkdown>
### Set up the Form

- Create a new form or open an existing one.
- Add fields for all of the information you'd like to collect, e.g. _Name_, _Email_, etc.
- Create a [Radios](../../forms/fields.mdx#radios) or [Dropdown](../../forms/fields.mdx#dropdown) field named **Amount** with all of the necessary predefined options with the **Use custom values** setting toggled on. Example:
    - `Select...`, ` `
    - `$100`,`100`
    - `$50`,`50`
    - `$20`,`20`
    - `Other`, `0`.
- Create a [Number](../../forms/fields.mdx#number) field named **Other** and place it below or beside the _Amount_ field you just created.
    - Set a **Default value** of `0` for it.
- Create a [Calculation](../../forms/fields.mdx#calculation) field named **Calculated Amount**.
- Create a second page for your form (let's name page 1 as **Details** and page 2 as **Payment**).
- In the **Payment** page (page 2), create and place a [Stripe](../../forms/fields.mdx#stripe-payment) field named **Payment Details**.
