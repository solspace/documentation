# Include an "Other" Option for Fields

It's possible to have an extra option inside your [Dropdown](../../forms/fields.mdx#dropdown) or [Radios](../../forms/fields.mdx#radios) field containing an "Other" choice, and when chosen, display an input field for them to fill in their other option.

While Freeform fields don't have this built-in, you can simulate this with the [Conditional Rules](../../forms/conditional-rules.mdx) feature. You can set it so that when a user selects the "Other" option in a Dropdown/Radios field, an extra field (its own field, not related to that Dropdown/Radios field) appears for the user to fill it in.

## Instructions

Here's how to do it:

<VerticalStepWrapper>
<StepMarkdown>
- Add an option named `Other` to one of your existing _Dropdown_ or _Radios_ fields (this can also apply to other field types as well).
    - For this example, we'll make it a Radio field and call it `Favorite Pie` with a handle of `favoritePie`.

</StepMarkdown>
<StepMarkdown>
- Create a new field of the _Text_ type and place it in the field layout close to your _Dropdown_ or _Radios_ field (wherever you'd like it to show up).
    - For this example, we'll call it `Provide your own flavor...` with a handle of `favoritePieOther`.
    - You might notice in the screenshot below that a blank [HTML block](../../forms/fields.mdx#html) was added at the right as a workaround to have the **Other** field not take the full width of the form.

</StepMarkdown>
<StepMarkdown>
- In the [Conditional Rules](../../forms/conditional-rules.mdx) tab, follow these steps:
    - Add rules to Page 1 (or whatever your page name is).
    - For _Field Rules_, select _Add..._ and choose the `Provide your own flavor...` field.
    - In the _Add criteria_ dropdown, choose the `Favorite Pie` field.
    - Set the other dropdown to be your new `Other` option.

</StepMarkdown>
