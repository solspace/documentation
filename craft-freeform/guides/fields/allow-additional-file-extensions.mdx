# Allow Additional File Extensions

If you wish to allow more file extensions to your [File Upload](../../forms/fields.mdx#file-upload) or [File Upload Drag & Drop](../../forms/fields.mdx#file-upload-drag--drop) fields, you will need to add the [extraAllowedFileExtensions](https://craftcms.com/docs/5.x/reference/config/general.html#extraallowedfileextensions) (and possibly [extraFileKinds](https://craftcms.com/docs/5.x/reference/config/general.html#extrafilekinds)) config items to your Craft config file.

### Modify the `config/general.php` file

Add the following to your `config/general.php` file:

```php
'extraAllowedFileExtensions' => 'heic',

'extraFileKinds' => [
    // merge .heic into list of Image file kinds
    'image' => [
        'extensions' => ['heic'],
    ],
],
```

The `extraFileKinds` part will merge `heic` into the list of valid **Image** file types and treat it as such when you check off _Image_ in the **Allowed File Kinds** setting for the field inside the Freeform form builder.

---

To add multiple file extensions, the config settings would look something like this:

```php
'extraAllowedFileExtensions' => 'psb, css, less, pcss, sass, scss, styl',

'extraFileKinds' => [
    // merge .psb into list of Photoshop file kinds
    'photoshop' => [
        'extensions' => ['psb'],
    ],
    // register new "Stylesheet" file kind
    'stylesheet' => [
        'label' => 'Stylesheet',
        'extensions' => ['css', 'less', 'pcss', 'sass', 'scss', 'styl'],
    ],
]
```

:::warning
If you do not categorize the file extensions like this, you must allow ALL file types for your field by unchecking all file types in the **Allowed File Kinds** settings for the additional extensions to work.

### Enable the File Kinds in the File Upload field

- Inside the form builder, click on any of the [File Upload](../../forms/fields.mdx#file-upload) or [File Upload Drag & Drop](../../forms/fields.mdx#file-upload-drag--drop) fields in your form.
- In the **File Kinds** setting in the property editor, please check off all applicable file kinds to be allowed.
- Save your form and verify it's working correctly.
