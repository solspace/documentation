# Creating a Custom Formatting Template

Freeform offers the most flexible and customizable options for handling the formatting of forms on the front end.
This is done with [formatting templates](../../templates/formatting/index.mdx), where you can assign them to forms
so Freeform knows how you'd like them to appear on the front end. You can simply choose from one of our popular
framework examples and add your own CSS to style them further, or you can create your very own formatting templates.

Sometimes are you want to do is change some accent colors or other minor details. This guide shows how you can
quickly get started with customizing your own formatting templates.

## Instructions

We strongly recommend [using an existing sample formatting template as a starting point](../../templates/formatting/index.mdx#sample-templates).
Freeform includes numerous examples and frameworks that show best practices, so we're certain you'll find one to use
as a starting point.

<Player
  url={require('@site/static/videos/craft/freeform/v5/custom-formatting-template.mp4').default}
  muted loop playing width="100%" height="100%"
/>

To do this, follow the steps below:

<VerticalStepWrapper>
<StepMarkdown>

Inside your Craft `templates` directory, create a folder on your server to store your custom formatting templates. For example,
a folder named `formatting` under a `_freeform` directory:

<Photo
  img={require('@site/static/img/craft/freeform/v5/guides/custom-formatting-template-1.png')}
  alt="Create a new folder to store the custom formatting templates"
  scale="70"
/>

</StepMarkdown>
<StepMarkdown>

In the Craft control panel, go to the [Template Manager](../../configuration/settings.mdx#template-manager) in the Settings area of Freeform.

Enter the relative path to your newly created `_freeform/formatting` directory. Freeform will automatically suggest existing paths:

<Photo
  img={require('@site/static/img/craft/freeform/v5/guides/custom-formatting-template-2.png')}
  alt="Enter the relative path to your newly created '_freeform/formatting' directory"
/>

</StepMarkdown>
<StepMarkdown>

Click the **Save** button at the top right.

Upon reload of the page, you'll see the following:

<Photo
  img={require('@site/static/img/craft/freeform/v5/guides/custom-formatting-template-3.png')}
  alt="Clone an existing sample formatting template to use as a starting point"
/>

Click on the **Clone a Sample Template** button and choose an existing sample formatting template to use as a starting point.

</StepMarkdown>
<StepMarkdown>

After successfully cloning a sample template, you'll see it appear on the page:

<Photo
  img={require('@site/static/img/craft/freeform/v5/guides/custom-formatting-template-5.png')}
  alt="New custom formatting template in CP"
/>

And in your `_freeform/formatting` directory:

<Photo
  img={require('@site/static/img/craft/freeform/v5/guides/custom-formatting-template-4.png')}
  alt="New custom formatting template on server"
  scale="70"
/>

</StepMarkdown>
<StepMarkdown>

You can rename your new custom formatting template by changing the name of the folder (in this case `tailwind-4-dark-1`) to whatever you like.

However, please note that you'll need to perform a _search and replace_ on your new `tailwind-4-dark-1` folder to replace any references of
`tailwind-4-dark-1` in the templates. This will be different depending on which sample template you cloned, but usually 3-5 places.

In the case of the Tailwind 4 templates, you'll need to change them in the following locations:

In `index.twig`:

<Photo
  img={require('@site/static/img/craft/freeform/v5/guides/custom-formatting-template-7a.png')}
  alt="Change file path references in 'index.twig'"
/>

In `_row.twig`:

<Photo
  img={require('@site/static/img/craft/freeform/v5/guides/custom-formatting-template-7b.png')}
  alt="Change file path references in '_row.twig'"
/>

In `/fields/group.twig`:

<Photo
  img={require('@site/static/img/craft/freeform/v5/guides/custom-formatting-template-7c.png')}
  alt="Change file path references in '/fields/group.twig'"
/>

</StepMarkdown>
<StepMarkdown>

Apply your new formatting template to one or more of your forms:

<Photo
  img={require('@site/static/img/craft/freeform/v5/guides/custom-formatting-template-8.png')}
  alt="Apply new custom formatting template inside the form builder"
/>

</StepMarkdown>
<StepMarkdown>

Make any changes you like to your new formatting template. We strongly suggest starting out small
and slowly make additional changes, checking them numerous times along the way.
