# Allow Additional File Extensions

If you wish to allow more file extensions to your [File Upload](../../forms/fields.mdx#file-upload) or [File Upload Drag & Drop](../../forms/fields.mdx#file-upload-drag--drop) fields, you will need to add the [extraAllowedFileExtensions](https://craftcms.com/docs/5.x/reference/config/general.html#extraallowedfileextensions) (and possibly [extraFileKinds](https://craftcms.com/docs/5.x/reference/config/general.html#extrafilekinds)) config items to your Craft config file.

    ### Modify the `config/general.php` file

    Add the following to your `config/general.php` file:

    ```php
    'extraAllowedFileExtensions' => 'heic',

    'extraFileKinds' => [
      // merge .heic into list of Image file kinds
      'image' => [
        'extensions' => ['heic'],
      ],
    ],
    ```

    The `extraFileKinds` part will merge `heic` into the list of valid **Image** file types and treat it as such when you check off _Image_ in the **Allowed File Kinds** setting for the field inside the Freeform form builder.

    To add multiple file extensions, the config settings would look something like this:

    ```php
    'extraAllowedFileExtensions' => 'psb, css, less, pcss, sass, scss, styl',

    'extraFileKinds' => [
      // merge .psb into list of Photoshop file kinds
      'photoshop' => [
        'extensions' => ['psb'],
      ],
      // register new "Stylesheet" file kind
      'stylesheet' => [
        'label' => 'Stylesheet',
        'extensions' => ['css', 'less', 'pcss', 'sass', 'scss', 'styl'],
      ],
    ]
    ```

    :::warning
    If you do not categorize the file extensions like this, you must allow ALL file types for your field by unchecking all file types in the **Allowed File Kinds** settings for the additional extensions to work.

    ### Enable the File Kinds in the File Upload field

    - Inside the form builder, click on any of the [File Upload](../../forms/fields.mdx#file-upload) or [File Upload Drag & Drop](../../forms/fields.mdx#file-upload-drag--drop) fields in your form.
    - In the **File Kinds** setting in the property editor, please check off all applicable file kinds to be allowed.
    - Save your form and verify it's working correctly.
