# Include an "Other" option for fields

You can add an additional option labeled "Other" to your [Dropdown](../../forms/fields.mdx#dropdown) or [Radios](../../forms/fields.mdx#radios) field. When users select this option, you can display an input field for them to specify their response.

While Freeform fields do not have this functionality built-in, you can achieve a similar effect using the [Conditional Rules](../../forms/conditional-rules.mdx) feature. You can configure it so that when a user selects the "Other" option in the Dropdown/Radios field, an additional field (which is independent of the Dropdown/Radios field) appears for the user to complete.

## Instructions

Here's how to do it:

<VerticalStepWrapper>
  <StepMarkdown>
    Add an option named `Other` to one of your existing _Dropdown_ or _Radios_ fields (this can also apply to other field types as well).

    For this example, we'll make it a [Radios](../../forms/fields.mdx#radios) field and call it `Favorite Pie` with a handle of `favoritePie`.

    <Photo
      img={require('@site/static/img/craft/freeform/v5/guides/other-option-builder-1.png')}
      alt="Add an 'Other' option to your field"
    />
  </StepMarkdown>
  <StepMarkdown>
    Create a new [Text](../../forms/fields.mdx#text) field and place it in the field layout close to your `Favorite Pie` _Radios_ field (wherever you'd like it to show up).

    For this example, we'll call it `Provide your own flavor...` with a handle of `favoritePieOther`.

    :::info
    You might notice in the screenshot below that a blank [HTML](../../forms/fields.mdx#html) field was added at the right as a workaround to have the **Other** field not take the full width of the form.

      alt="Create your 'Other' field"
    />
  </StepMarkdown>
  <StepMarkdown>
    In the Conditional [Rules](../../forms/conditional-rules.mdx) tab, follow these steps:

    - Click on the `Provide your own flavor...` field on the left column.
    - Click the **Add rules** button.
    - In the criteria section below, select your `Favorite Pie` field.
    - For the logic, choose `is equal to`.
    - Select `Other` for the field option.

  </StepMarkdown>
  <StepMarkdown>
    Save the form and check it out on the front end:

      url={require('@site/static/videos/craft/freeform/v5/guide-other-field.mp4').default}
      muted loop playing width="100%" height="100%"
    />
  </StepMarkdown>
