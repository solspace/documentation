# Display Total Number of Submissions for a Form

If you wish to display the total number of submissions a Freeform form has received, you can do this by including the `.count` function on the [Submissions Query](../../templates/queries/submissions.mdx).

## Instructions

Your template code would look as simple as this:

```twig showLineNumbers
{{ freeform.submissions({formId: form.id}).count }}
```

A real-world example might look something like this:

```twig {9} showLineNumbers
{% set forms = freeform.forms %}

<h2>List of All Forms</h2>

{% for form in forms %}
    <div class="form-card">
        <h4>{{ form.name }}</h4>
        <p>{{ form.description }}</p>
        <p>{{ freeform.submissions({formId: form.id}).count }} Submissions</p>
    </div>
{% endfor %}
```

### Spam Count

If you'd like to display the total number of submissions in the spam folder for a form, just add `isSpam: true` to the query:

```twig showLineNumbers
{{ freeform.submissions({formId: form.id, isSpam: true}).count }}
```
