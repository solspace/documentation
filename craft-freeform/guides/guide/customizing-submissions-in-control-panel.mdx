# Customizing Submission Columns View in Control Panel

The **Submissions** index view in the Freeform control panel is completely customizable similar to how it is done with other elements like Craft Entries, etc.
If you'd like to customize which field columns display in the **Submissions** index view in the Freeform control panel, follow the steps below:

<VerticalStepWrapper>
  <StepMarkdown>
    Go to the **Submissions** index view in the Freeform control panel.
  </StepMarkdown>
  <StepMarkdown>
    Click on a form filter at the left (it will not work on the _All Submissions_ filter as every form can and will have a different set fields).

      alt="Choose a Form filter on the left column"
    />
  </StepMarkdown>
  <StepMarkdown>
    At the top right, click on the **View** dropdown button. You'll then be able to select which columns are to be visible, the order of them, and the sort order of the submissions.
