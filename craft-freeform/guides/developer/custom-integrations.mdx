# Can I make my own integrations or fields?

If our current offering of [Fields](../../forms/fields.mdx) and [Integrations](../../integrations/index.mdx) does not include a service you require, you have a few options available:

## Development Guides

For your convenience, we have included several guides to help you build your own custom fields and integrations:

<FlexCards
  items={[
    {
      title: 'Custom Field Types',
      description: 'Easily create your own custom field types.',
      icon: Icons.FieldTextIcon,
      fullCardLink: '../../developer/field-types/',
    },
    {
      title: 'Custom Email Marketing',
      description: 'Create your own email marketing and add it to Freeform.',
      icon: Icons.MegaphoneIcon,
      fullCardLink: '../../developer/email-marketing/',
    },
    {
      title: 'Custom Webhooks',
      description: 'Create your own webhook and add it to Freeform.',
      icon: Icons.WebhookIcon,
      fullCardLink: '../../developer/webhooks/',
    },
  ]}
/>

## Other Options

### Reverse-engineer an Existing Integration

Reverse-engineer an existing integration available to see how it was done, and build your own. We highly recommend you follow the [development guides](#development-guides) mentioned above, if available.

### Developer Events

Use the [Developer Events](../../developer/events/form.mdx) to build a custom module to handle any custom behavior your project needs.

### POST Forwarding

Depending on your project's needs, you may be able to use the [POST Forwarding](../../integrations/post-forwarding.mdx) feature, which is theoretically a simplistic but fast way to pass off your submission data to the CRM or Email Marketing service if they have an endpoint that can be posted to.

### Custom Software Development Services

Finally, we also offer [custom software development services](/support/premium/). If you need a custom solution built for you, our team is capable of building something for your needs. Just [reach out to us](/support/) and we can discuss further.
