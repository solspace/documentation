  subtitle="Frequently asked questions about buying Calendar."
  imgSrc={Icons.QuestionSignIcon}
>
  <div class="faq-list">
  <details>
    <summary>Can I test Calendar before I buy?</summary>

    Yes! You can use Calendar on any private domain name for as long as you need, just like with Craft. Whether it's on your local dev server or a staging site, you're good to go. You only have to buy a license when you're ready to launch your site live, just like with Craft.
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>How many sites does a license cover?</summary>

    You only need to buy a Calendar license for each Craft license you have. So, if you're running a Craft multi-site on one install, you just need one license. It's just like Craft! There's no need to get separate licenses for other environments of the same site, like development or staging.
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Can I switch to a different edition later?</summary>

    Yes! You can switch to the _Lite_ or _Pro_ editions at any time! You just pay the difference in price. For example, if you're using the _Lite_ edition and wish to switch to _Pro_, you will just pay $100. You don't need to reinstall anything and you won't lose any of your data.

    Check out the [Changing Editions](./setup/installing-updating/#changing-editions) guide for more information!
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Do you offer discounts to non-profits?</summary>

    Yes! We offer a discount to non-profits for 20% off the regular price upon proof of non-profit status. Please [contact us](/support/) for more information about this.
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Does the Trial version limit features?</summary>

    The trial versions of Solspace software are fully functional and not limited in any way. However, if you try to use a trial version on a production site, Craft will display a red banner at the top of your control panel, prompting you to purchase a license.

    More information about [Craft's license enforcement](https://craftcms.com/knowledge-base/how-craft-license-enforcement-works).
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>How long does a license last for?</summary>

    A single license provides one year of updates and support. After this period, you can continue using the plugin but will no longer receive updates or support. To maintain access to updates and support, you will need to renew your license each year at a discounted rate.
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Do I have to renew my license each year?</summary>

    You can renew your license after the initial one-year support period has ended. Your plugin will continue to work properly in the meantime. If you prefer, you can wait until the following year to renew and receive the latest updates.
    
    However, we don't recommend avoiding updates altogether, as you would miss out on new features and important fixes.
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>What are renewals and how do they work?</summary>

    Renewals help you keep your plugin updated and access technical support. However, they are entirely optional.
    
    For example, if you purchase the _Lite_ edition of Calendar for $99, the renewal price after one year is $49. Your initial purchase of $99 includes support and updates for one year. When it's time to renew, you can extend your updates and support for another year at the renewal price of just $49, rather than paying the full amount of $99 again.
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>How do I install Calendar?</summary>

    Installing Calendar is done just like any other plugin for Craft, similar to how you would install Craft itself. Please refer to the [Installation guide](./setup/installing-updating.mdx) in the documentation.
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>How do I get support for Calendar?</summary>

    We provide free support for Calendar. If you have any questions or encounter issues, you can [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/solspace/craft-calendar/issues/new/choose) or [send us a private support ticket](/support/). We're here to help!
