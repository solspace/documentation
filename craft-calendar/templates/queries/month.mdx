# Month Query

The _calendar.month_ template query assembles a [Month object](../objects/month.mdx) containing its events and allows for iteration over it to access all [Week objects](../objects/week.mdx) contained within, which in turn contain their respective [Day objects](../objects/day.mdx), which in turn contain their respective [Hour objects](../objects/hour.mdx).

## Parameters

- `date`
  - A date string representing a date within the month that should be compiled.
  - `"march 2023"` is a valid `date` value
  - `"2023-03-01"` or even `"2023-03-15 12:33"` would be valid and return the [Month object](../objects/month.mdx) for **March 2023**
- `calendar`
  - Handle of the calendar, e.g. `"holidays"`, or an array of handles: `["holidays", "football"]`.
  - Use `"not holidays"` to select all calendars EXCEPT the **Holidays** calendar
- `calendarId`
  - An ID of the calendar, or array of ID's, e.g. `[1, 2, 3]`
  - If you want to select all calendars EXCEPT the calendar with an ID of **1**, use `"not 1"`
- `allDay`
  - Selects only events that are set to be **All Day** events went set to `true`.
- `authorId`
  - Selects events from specific author ID's
- `limit`
  - Supply an `int` to limit the amount of events returned
- `orderBy`
  - Override default sort order by for each day with this parameter, e.g. `orderBy: "startDate ASC"`
- `status`
  - By default, `live` is used, showing only enabled events
  - Can be set to `disabled` to show disabled events
  - Or `null` to show all events regardless of their status
- `loadOccurrences`
  - Set this to `false` to not load any recurring events. Default is `true`.
  - When setting this to `false`, Calendar will display only the very first occurrence in the results ONLY if that same occurrence falls within the Month date range. It will NOT just show the next recurrence available, and does NOT show any events that just have recurrences within the Month date range.
- `firstDay`
  - An `int` value representing the first day of week.
  - Defaults to the currently logged in user's first day of week.
  - If user not logged in, it defaults to the global **First Day of Week** Craft setting
  - Accepts `int` values from `0-6`, `0` being **Sunday**, `6` being **Saturday**
- `search: "customField:myvalue*"`
  - Works just like regular [Craft Searching](https://craftcms.com/docs/4.x/searching.html).
    :::warning
    There's currently a known issue where searches combined with `calendar` parameter will not work. Use `calendarId` instead for now.
    :::
- `relatedTo: event.id`
  - Works just like regular [Craft Relations](https://craftcms.com/docs/4.x/relations.html#templating).
