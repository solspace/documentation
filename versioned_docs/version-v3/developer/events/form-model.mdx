# Form Model Events

Use these events to perform actions when the form model is being changed.

## Before Saving the Form

This event is called when the form is being saved. Use it to manipulate the form data before it's saved.

```php showLineNumbers
use Solspace\Freeform\Services\FormsService;
use Solspace\Freeform\Events\Forms\SaveEvent;

Event::on(
  FormsService::class,
  FormsService::EVENT_BEFORE_SAVE,
  function (SaveEvent $event) {
    $formModel = $event->getModel();

    // Force all forms have the same name
    $formModel->name = "A static name";
  }
)
```

## After Saving the Form

Use this event to perform some task after the form is saved.

```php showLineNumbers
use Solspace\Freeform\Services\FormsService;
use Solspace\Freeform\Events\Forms\SaveEvent;

Event::on(
  FormsService::class,
  FormsService::EVENT_AFTER_SAVE,
  function (SaveEvent $event) {
    if ($event->isNew()) {
      // If the form is new
      // Perform some action here
    }
  }
)
```

## Before Deleting a Form

```php showLineNumbers
use Solspace\Freeform\Services\FormsService;
use Solspace\Freeform\Events\Forms\DeleteEvent;

Event::on(
  FormsService::class,
  FormsService::EVENT_BEFORE_DELETE,
  function (DeleteEvent $event) {
    $formModel = $event->getModel();
    $formId = $formModel->id;

    // Delete some db records based on the form ID
  }
)
```

## After Deleting a Form

```php showLineNumbers
use Solspace\Freeform\Services\FormsService;
use Solspace\Freeform\Events\Forms\DeleteEvent;

Event::on(
  FormsService::class,
  FormsService::EVENT_AFTER_DELETE,
  function (DeleteEvent $event) {
    $formModel = $event->getModel();
