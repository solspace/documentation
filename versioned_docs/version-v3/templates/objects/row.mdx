# Row object

The Row object contains all of the [Fields](./field.mdx) assigned to it in the form builder. It can contain up to 4 fields/columns. The Row object doesn't contain any properties, methods or non render field types such as a [Hidden](../../forms/fields.mdx#hidden) fields. Instead, it's an iterable object where you have to iterate over it to get the [Fields](./field.mdx) contained within.

## Usage in Templates

Render all rows and fields of the currently active page within a form:

```twig showLineNumbers
{% for row in form %}
  <div class="row">
    {% for field in row %}
      <div class="field">
        {{ field.label }}
      </div>
    {% endfor %}
  </div>
{% endfor %}
```
