# Showcase

Freeform is used by thousands of websites and because it's so versatile, it is often used in a wide variety of ways. Here's a short list of websites currently using Freeform.

:::info
If you have an interesting implementation of Freeform you'd like us to add to the Freeform Showcase, please [contact us](/support/) with the link and details.
:::

## Craft Demo Sites

We are pleased that Craft has chosen to include Freeform in both of their website demos. These demos allow you to experience Craft from the control panel and front end website. Because of this, you can also experience Freeform inside the control panel as well. Be sure to visit the **Plugin Store** area of the Craft control panel to switch the license edition to **Pro** to get the full experience of Freeform! P.S. The form used to request access to the demo sites is also built on Freeform. ðŸ™‚

This website uses Freeform to handle contact forms as well as payment processing (via the [Stripe Payments integration](../integrations/stripe-payments.mdx)) to allow users to sign up and pay for mock exams. A fair bit of customization was done to have the payment amount (left side) appear dynamically and in a very styled way.
