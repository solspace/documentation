# Email Testing with Mailtrap

When building and setting up your site locally, you might wish to test and debug email notifications from Freeform without bothering your client and/or setting up an email server on your development environment. In cases like this, we highly recommend trying out an email testing service such as [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/).

Mailtrap simulates a real SMTP server and allows you to see that each email notification was sent, as well as view all of the recipients' email messages in a single unified inbox, complete with tools to analyze and troubleshoot. This speeds up the testing process and lets you verify how each notification is rendered, etc. For more information, [click here to see how it works](https://mailtrap.io/how-it-works).

Follow the instructions below to set up Mailtrap for Craft (which then hijacks/controls all email notifications from Craft and Freeform, etc):

## Instructions

<VerticalStepWrapper>
<StepMarkdown>

- [Sign up for a Mailtrap account](https://mailtrap.io/register/signup).
- Select the _Free_ account to start (or a paid account if you think you need it).
  - Please note that the _Free_ account does have some limitations:
    - Maximum 500 emails per month
    - Maximum 5 emails every 10 seconds
      :::warning
      This is important to note, as some Freeform forms may be generating more than 5 email notifications. If so, Mailtrap will only collect/display 5 of the X number of notifications from Freeform.

Once your account has been created, click into your new inbox (probably named _Demo inbox_). The inbox page will default to having an _SMTP Settings_ tab open with credentials.
