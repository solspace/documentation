# Submission Editing <Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

Freeform allows you to edit submissions via the front end templates as well. Currently, this feature has no user/author check, and requires you use/provide the `submission.token` to work (as opposed to the ID). A future version will likely include ability to check on authors, etc. The editing uses the same `freeform.form` function, but knows you're in **edit mode** when you feed the `submissionToken` parameter a valid value.

:::warning
There are currently some limitations with this feature. Please note that:

- Not all types of forms can be intuitively edited (e.g. [Payment](../integrations/stripe-payments.mdx) forms, some complex ones, etc).
- Editing [Payment](../integrations/stripe-payments.mdx) forms will NOT update payment details, but instead will make a new submission/charge.
- Editing forms with [Element integrations](../integrations/elements.mdx) will NOT update the corresponding element, but just create a new one instead (so currently no editing of user profile data, etc).

## Overview

When linking to the form edit, you might use something like this inside the [Submissions query](../templates/queries/submissions.mdx):

```twig showLineNumbers
{% if currentUser and currentUser.admin %}
    <a href="{{ siteUrl }}page/{{ form.handle }}/edit/{{ submission.token }}">
        {{ "Edit"|t("freeform") }}
    </a>
{% endif %}
```

Then in your template that includes the [Form query](../templates/queries/form.mdx), be sure that the `submissionToken` parameter is included and checking the URL for a value:

```twig showLineNumbers{1,5}
{% set submissionToken = craft.app.request.segment(4) %}

{% set form = freeform.form('myForm', {
    returnUrl: "{{ siteUrl }}page/{{ form.handle }}/submission/{{ submission.id }}/success",
    submissionToken: submissionToken|default(null),
}) %}
```

You can also check out the example in the [demo templates](../configuration/demo-templates.mdx) if you wish to see it in action.

### Suppression of Notifications and more

You can apply the `suppress` parameter to the [Form](../templates/queries/form.mdx) and `render` queries, which allows you to suppress email notifications, API integrations and [Element Connections](../integrations/elements.mdx) for a form by passing an object of suppressions you wish to enable, typically used for editing submissions, e.g.:

- `adminNotifications: true` - suppress [Admin notifications](../forms/email-notifications/#admin-notifications)
- `dynamicRecipients: true` - suppress [Dynamic Recipient notifications](../forms/email-notifications#dynamic-recipients)
- `submitterNotifications: true` - suppress [Submitter email notifications](../forms/email-notifications#user-submitter-notifications)
- `api: true` - suppress [CRM](../integrations#crm) and [Email Marketing](../integrations/#email-marketing) integrations
- `connections: true` - suppress [Element Connections](../integrations/#elements)
- `payments: true` - suppress [Payment](../integrations/#other) integrations

You can also just set this to `true` (`suppress: true`) to enable all suppressions at once.

### Examples

```twig {5-10} showLineNumbers
{% set form = craft.freeform.form("myForm", {
	id: "myform",
	class: "form-class",
    submissionToken: submissionToken|default(null),
    suppress: {
        adminNotifications: true,
        dynamicRecipients: true,
        submitterNotifications: true,
        api: true
    }
}) %}
```

OR

```twig {5} showLineNumbers
{% set form = craft.freeform.form("myForm", {
	id: "myform",
	class: "form-class",
    submissionToken: submissionToken|default(null),
    suppress: true
}) %}
```
