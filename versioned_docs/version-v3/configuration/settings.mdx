# Plugin Settings

Freeform includes a wide variety of settings that allow you to customize your form management experience. To adjust your settings, click the **Settings** menu item while in the Freeform plugin, or go to **Settings → Plugins → Freeform** and click the settings link. These can also be configured within your Craft [Project Config](./project-config.mdx) file

### Freeform Javascript Insertion Location

The location of where you want Freeform to insert it's scripts for form and field functionality (such as spam protection and advanced field types).

- **Page Footer**
- **Inside Form**
- **None** (manually load the JS instead)<Badge type="feature" text="Revised 3.11+" />
  - If you choose this option, please be sure to manually load Freeform's JS with `/freeform/plugin.js` and CSS with `/freeform/plugin.css` (optional, as it's currently just for the Opinion field type handling) in your template(s). See [Freeform JS plugin](../developer/js-plugin.mdx#loading-freeform-js-manually) documentation for more information.

### Freeform Script Insert Type

Specify the way Freeform scripts are inserted.

- **As Static URLs**<Badge type="recommended" text="Recommended" /> - offers built-in browser caching and a static endpoint that delivers the latest Freeform scripts, but are not physical files and therefore cannot have server rules applied.
- **As Files** - (recommended if having issues with Static URLs) are actual physical files generated inside of the 'cpresources' folder by Craft's asset manager with no caching.
- **Inline** - will add the scripts as inline scripts and may be useful as a workaround if the other 2 options are not working. This doesn't allow for caching, and pollutes the source code.

### Freeform Session Context<Badge type="feature" text="3.12+" />

Choose the way form context is passed between form submits.

- **As an encrypted payload**<Badge type="recommended" text="Recommended" />
  - The key benefits are that it never stores anything anywhere, has no impact on the server, and can be cached out-of-the-box.
- **Using PHP's sessions**
  - The key benefits are that it stores the context in memory and everything per session ID.
  - The problems with this approach are that it expires eventually with no way to persist this for longer periods of time. It's also unreliable due to _garbage collection_ on most servers which typically runs every 24 min­utes by default.
- **Using a database table**
  - The key benefits are that the context is stored in the database reliably for as long as you wish, offering more control if you have large forms that take a very long time to complete.
  - The problems with this approach is that high traffic sites may run into performance issues as the database table fills up and attempts to clear regularly, etc.

### Formatting Templates

Formatting templates are predefined templates that you can specify for forms to handle simplified rendering of the form on the front end. You can have as many as you wish, and customize them however you like.

## Email Templates

:::info
If you wish to create advanced notification templates, please note that any additional template files (e.g. `_layout.twig`, `_footer.html`, etc) must NOT be stored inside of this directory, as Freeform expects that every file in here is a complete email notification template and will choke on any additional files.
:::

:::warning
As of Freeform 3.11, **database-based email notification templates are deprecated**. They will continue to work throughout the Freeform v3.x major version, but will likely be removed in v4. Freeform 3.11 introduces the ability to create and update file-based email notification templates directly inside the control panel, thus making the database-style notification template approach redundant. Freeform 3.11+ includes a utility to convert all existing database-style email notification templates over to file-based ones at your convenience (see below).
:::

### Migrate from Database Email Templates to File Email Templates<Badge type="feature" text="3.11+" />

This is a utility that allows you to migrate your existing database email templates over to file-based email templates (you can continue to edit these from the CP). The utility will also update all existing forms to use the new file version of the email template. If you wish to have Freeform clean up and remove the old database email templates after, check the checkbox as well.

### Success Templates<Badge type="feature" text="3.13+" />

Success templates are predefined templates that you can specify for your forms to display when a form has been successfully submitted. Instead of redirecting to a return URL or reloading the form, it'll display the contents of this template. You can have as many as you wish, and customize them however you like. To use these, be sure to select the **Load Success Template** option for the **Success Behavior** setting in the form builder for each form.

:::info
If using the **Custom Honeypot Field Name** setting, be careful when choosing a custom name, as it's possible the user's browser auto-fill settings may accidentally fill out the field unbeknownst to them (e.g. `email_address2`).
:::

:::info
Enabling the **Spam Folder** feature will not retroactively bring back any previously blocked spam submissions. Any submissions that have been blocked in the past (without Spam Folder setting on) are never recorded in the database.
:::

:::warning
Enabling the **Purge Submissions** feature and saving this settings page will result in purging feature beginning, and cannot be undone (it may not happen immediately, and may take a couple hours before the next process runs). This process will only run every hour, and only when Freeform is accessed on the front end in templates or in the control panel.
:::

:::info
When attempting to block individual characters (e.g. Russian letters) or partial words or strings with the **Block Keywords** setting, be sure to make good use of the wildcard `*` character! E.g.: `*й*`, `*Д*`, `*url=http*`, etc.
:::

## Captchas

Freeform currently supports several options of _reCAPTCHA_ and _hCaptcha_<Badge type="feature" text="3.12.9+" />.

:::info
This page and its settings all become inaccessible when the Craft `allowAdminChanges` config setting is set to `false`.

:::info
To add the **reCAPTCHA v2 Checkbox** or **hCaptcha Checkbox** to your forms, open up each form in the form builder and drag over the **Captcha** special field anywhere you like into your form layout.

**reCAPTCHA v2 Invisible** and **reCAPTCHA v3** will automatically load a _reCAPTCHA_ icon in the bottom right corner of your site containing the form. This is required by Google's terms of service. There are CSS workarounds if you wish to locate the icon to the left side of the browser page, etc.

## Notices & Alerts

Freeform is committed to being the most robust and reliable form plugin for Craft CMS. Freeform has been carefully and meticulously developed and tested over many years and is in use across tens of thousands of websites. However, one other crutial piece of the puzzle in reliability is how your specific site and environment are performing. Because of this, Freeform includes an extensive error logging feature, email issue alerts, an Update Notices feature to alert you of important fixes and changes, and a weekly digest email to keep your finger on the pulse of your website.

:::warning
This page and its settings all become inaccessible when the Craft `allowAdminChanges` config setting is set to `false`.

## Error Log

In as many cases as possible, Freeform attempts to write errors and issues to its own error log. The file is physically located in the same place as the Craft logs (`/storage/logs/freeform.log`), but can be conveniently viewed inside the _Error Log_ page inside Freeform Settings area (**Freeform** → **Settings** → **Error Log**). If there are no logged errors, the Error Log page will not show any errors, and you will likely not see the Freeform error log file.
