Freeform 3.12+ includes a self-diagnostics page that may help you track down potential issues with your setup, or give to you the ability to easily share diagnostic results with Solspace Support to assist you faster.

Whenever you're encountering issues with your site, check out this page in your control panel to see if anything is noted. It's also advisable to visit this page during the initial setup of Freeform or updates on your site to ensure you meet all of the necessary requirements and pass all the checks.

When requesting support with Freeform, support staff may ask you to provide a screenshot of this page as well.
