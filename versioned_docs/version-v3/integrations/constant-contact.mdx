# Constant Contact Integration<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" /><Badge type="feature" text="3.6.7+, Revised 3.13.4+" />

This documentation page assumes you have read over the [Email Marketing Integration Overview](./index.mdx#email-marketing). If you have not yet read it, please do so now. We assume that you have a [Constant Contact ](http://constantcontact.com) account already, along with mailing list(s) already created. This integration requires that you have _Freeform Pro_. If you currently have Freeform Lite, you can purchase an upgrade to Freeform Pro.

:::info
In early 2022, [Constant Contact announced changes to their API service](https://v3.developer.constantcontact.com/api_guide/auth_update_apps.html). This is a change that breaks existing integrations, and requires an update to Freeform in order to fix the connection. For existing Constant Contact users (set up before 3.13.4), please see the [special update instructions](#2022-update-instructions).

   - In the list of your application(s), it likely will appear under an **Outdated Applications** list.
   - Click on the **Copy** button for that application, and a copy of the integration application will be created.
   - Open up that application and ensure that Constant Contact's **Redirect URI** field contains the valid URL from Freeform's **Redirect URI** field.
     - If not, you can copy and paste that in here now and click the **Save** button at the top right.
4. Go back to your your Craft/Freeform browser tab.
5. Inside that settings page, click on the **Click here to re-authorize** link.
6. You will then be presented a Constant Contact OAuth confirmation page. Click on the **Allow Access** button.
