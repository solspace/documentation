# Plugin Settings

_Solspace Freeform_ includes several settings that allow you to customize your form management experience. To adjust your settings, click the **Settings** menu item while in the Freeform plugin, or go to **Settings > Plugins > Freeform** and click the settings link.

The settings allow you to adjust:

## General Settings

<Photo img={GeneralPhoto} alt="General Settings" />

- **Custom Plugin Name** <a href="#custom-name" id="custom-name" class="docs-anchor">#</a>
  - Override the plugin name by specifying your own here.
- **Show Composer Tutorial** <a href="#composer-tutorial" id="composer-tutorial" class="docs-anchor">#</a>
  - Enable this to show the interactive tutorial again in Composer. This setting disables again when the tutorial is completed or skipped.
- **Default view** <a href="#default-view" id="default-view" class="docs-anchor">#</a>
  - This setting allows you to specify which Freeform page should be loaded by default when clicking the Freeform navigation link.
  - Options are:
    - Dashboard (default)
    - Forms
    - Submissions
- **Display Order of Fields in Composer** <a href="#composer-display-order" id="composer-display-order" class="docs-anchor">#</a>
  - The display order for the list of available fields in Composer:
    - **Field type, Field name (alphabetical)**
    - **Field name (alphabetical)**
- **Render HTML inside Composer & Submissions view?** <Badge type="feature" text="2.5.0+" /> <a href="#composer-render-html" id="composer-render-html" class="docs-anchor">#</a>
  - Live rendering HTML in HTML blocks, field labels and option labels inside the Composer interface can sometimes conflict with Freeform's display of the form preview inside the control panel. In cases like these, you'll need to disable this setting to prevent HTML from rendering automatically.
- **Include Default Freeform Formatting Templates** <a href="#include-default-templates" id="include-default-templates" class="docs-anchor">#</a>
  - Disable this to hide the default Freeform formatting templates in the Formatting Template options list inside Composer.
- **Remove Newlines from Textareas for Exporting** <a href="#remove-newlines-exporting" id="remove-newlines-exporting" class="docs-anchor">#</a>
  - Enable this to have newlines removed from Textarea fields in submissions when exporting.
- **Disable Submit Button on Form Submit?** <a href="#disable-submit" id="disable-submit" class="docs-anchor">#</a>
  - Enable this to automatically disable the form's submit button when the user submits the form. This will prevent the form from double-submitting.
- **Automatically Scroll to Form on Errors and Multipage forms?** <a href="#auto-scroll" id="auto-scroll" class="docs-anchor">#</a>
  - Enable this to have Freeform use JS to automatically scroll the page down to the form upon submit when there are errors or the form is continuing to the next page in multipage forms.
- **Freeform Javascript Insertion Location** <a href="#scripts-location" id="scripts-location" class="docs-anchor">#</a>
  - The location of where you want Freeform to insert it's scripts for form and field functionality (such as spam protection and advanced field types). This setting should be set to **Inside Form** to work with AJAX.
    - **Page Footer**
    - **Inside Form**
- **Automatically Purge Submission Data** <Badge type="feature" text="2.0.1+" /> <a href="#auto-purge-data" id="auto-purge-data" class="docs-anchor">#</a>
  - If you wish to have Freeform automatically purge submission data after a specified number of days, enable this setting and specify the number of days after submission date it should purge submissions.
    - **WARNING:** Enabling this and saving this settings page will result in purging beginning.
    - **Days After Submission Date to Purge**
      - Select the number of days after submissions have been submitted for Freeform to begin automatically purging. This process will only run every hour, and only when Freeform is accessed on the front end in templates or in the control panel.

## Formatting Templates

- **Directory Path** <a href="#formatting-directory-path" id="formatting-directory-path" class="docs-anchor">#</a>
  - When using custom formatting templates for your forms, you'll need to specify where your Twig-based templates are stored.
  - Provide a relative path to craft root to your custom form templates directory.
    - E.g. **templates/freeform**
  - To add a starter example template, click the "Add a sample template" button, and then edit the template after.

    - Enable this if you'd like field-based errors to display under the email field(s) that the user has entered blocked emails for. Not recommended for regular use, but helpful if trying to troubleshoot submission issues.

## Error Log

In as many cases as possible, Freeform attempts to write errors and issues to its own error log. The file is physically located in the same place as the Craft logs (`/storage/logs/freeform.log`), but can be conveniently viewed inside the _Error Log_ page inside Freeform Settings area (**Freeform** -> **Settings** -> **Error Log**). If there are no logged errors, the Error Log page will not show any errors, and you will likely not see the Freeform error log file.
