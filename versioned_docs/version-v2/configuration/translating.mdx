# Translating

All of the Freeform control panel is translatable. Front end template translating of fields and error messages is also available.

To make a translation, follow Craft's instructions for [Translating Static Text](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/static-translations.html), and then check out the Freeform-specific guide below:

- Duplicate the _freeform.php_ file inside the Freeform plugin located at the **./vendor/solspace/craft3-freeform/src/translations/en-US** folder, and move it into the language ID folder (e.g. `de`) of your Craft **./translations/** directory. If the _translations_ directory does not yet exist, you'll need to create it (e.g. `./translations/de/freeform.php`). You can then update those language keys inside your Freeform translation file.
- If you also have [Freeform Payments](../integrations#other), duplicate the _freeform-payments.php_ file inside the Freeform Payments plugin located at the **./vendor/solspace/craft3-freeform-payments/src/translations/en-US** folder, and add it into your Craft **./translations/** directory (e.g. `./translations/de/freeform-payments.php`). You can then update those language keys inside the file.

Visit the Craft documentation for more information about [Setting Up a Localized Site](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/localization.html).

If you'd like to share your translation with others, [send us and email](/support) with a link to the translation file, and we'll consider including it in the main Solspace Freeform plugin package.
