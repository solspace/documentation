# Formatting Template

Freeform includes several example formatting templates to choose from. You can use these as a starting point and adjust them to suit your needs, or simply create your own from scratch. The following formatting templates are located in the /vendor/solspace/craft3-freeform/src/templates/\_defaultFormTemplates/ directory. If you wish to create your own modified version, just copy the code, or the template file (ex: foundation.html) and paste it into your Formatting Templates directory in the specified Craft Templates directory (ex: /templates/freeform/), and rename it to whatever you like.
