# Pipedrive<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

This documentation page assumes you have read over the [CRM Integration Overview](./index.mdx#crm). If you have not yet read it, please do so now. We also assume that you have a [Pipedrive](http://pipedrive.com) account already. If you currently have Freeform Lite, you can purchase an upgrade to Freeform Pro.

Includes support for the following:

- Field mapping to standard and custom fields.
- Maps data to [Deals](https://developers.pipedrive.com/docs/api/v1/#!/Deals), [Persons](https://developers.pipedrive.com/docs/api/v1/#!/Persons), [Organizations](https://developers.pipedrive.com/docs/api/v1/#!/Organizations) and [Notes](https://developers.pipedrive.com/docs/api/v1/#!/Notes) endpoints.

#### Verify Authorization

    * After the integration is saved, it'll return you to the list of CRM integrations.
    * Click into the newly created integration.
    * Confirm that there is green circle with **Authorized** in the middle of the page.
    * That's it! You can now use this integration inside Composer.

If you want to specify which user and/or deal stage the leads go into, you can specify the unique ID's for each of those in the **User ID** and **Stage ID** fields, but this is optional. There seems to be no visual way in Pipedrive to see what the ID's are, so you'll likely need to do something like right-clicking on a Stage name / User name link to view the ID in a URL. So for example, to get the Stage ID, go to the **Settings** area and click on **Pipelines**. Right-click on a stage name and copy the link. You'll get something like:
`https://yourcompany.pipedrive.com/stages/edit/3.json` (where `3` is the stage ID in this case). The stage ID is unique, so Pipedrive will automatically know which pipeline you're referring to when you specify the stage ID.
