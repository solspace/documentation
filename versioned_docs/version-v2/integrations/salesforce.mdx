We also assume that you have a [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com) account already. This integration requires that you have _Freeform Pro_.

#### Prepare Salesforce's end for Integration

:::warning
This integration will not work with the _Salesforce **Essentials**_ plan as it does not have access to the API.
:::

- Open another browser tab and go to [Salesforce website](https://login.salesforce.com) and log into your account.
- On the left navigation menu, click on **Apps**, then click **App Manager**.
- At the top right corner of the page, click the **New Connected App** button.
- Fill out the fields in the **Basic Information** section.
- In the **API (Enable OAuth Settings)** section, click the **Enable OAuth Settings** checkbox.
- More fields will appear. In the **Callback URL** field, enter any valid URL that begins with **https** (it could even be **https://google.com**, as we don't use this part).
- In the **Selected OAuth Scopes** field, select the following permissions from the list and click **Add** arrow button:
  - **Allow access to your unique identifier (openid)**
  - **Perform requests on your behalf at any time (refresh_token, offline_access)**
- You shouldn't need to fill out any further fields, and then click **Save** button.
- You will be taken to a new page that lists info about your newly created app, including **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret** values. You will need to copy each of these values.
  - Salesforce gets tricky to navigate, so do yourself a favor and copy and paste these 2 values into a text editor for now, being sure to label each too. You'll save yourself some extra steps later on.
- At the top middle of the page, click on the **Manage** button.
- At the top middle of the next page, click the **Edit Policies** button.
- Under the **OAuth policies** section, adjust the following settings:
  - In the **Permitted Users** field, be sure that it is set to **All users may self-authorize**.
  - In the **IP Relaxation** field, change the setting to **Relaxed IP restrictions**.
  - Click **Save** button at bottom of page.
- If you copy and pasted the **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret** values in a text editor, you can skip these next couple steps:
  - To go back to your app to see these values, click on the **App Manager** navigation item (under **Apps**)
  - Find your app in the list. Then in the right column, click the down arrow, and then click **View**.

### Alternate Config File Setup

The Salesforce Lead integration allows you the choice of entering your API keys and credentials via a config file instead if you wish. For more information about Freeform's config overrides, please see [Freeform Config Overrides](../configuration/project-overrides.mdx#freeform-pro) documentation. A brief overview is below:

- Copy and paste the following code into a new file named `freeform.php` and place it into your Craft `/config/` directory:

  ```php showLineNumbers
  <?php

  return [
      "salesforce_client_id"     => null,
      "salesforce_client_secret" => null,
      "salesforce_username"      => null,
      "salesforce_password"      => null,
  ];
  ```

- Replace the `null` value for **salesforce_client_id** with the Salesforce **Consumer Key** value.
- Replace the `null` value for **salesforce_client_secret** with the Salesforce **Consumer Secret** value.
- Replace the `null` value for **salesforce_username** with your Salesforce account username/email address.
- Replace the `null` value for **salesforce_password** with your Salesforce account password.
- Save the changes in the **freeform.php** file.
- Your final file should look something like this:

  ```php showLineNumbers
  <?php

  return [
      "salesforce_client_id"     => "7SDf7GFDG6O76sd798FdG98s9897F9G7dSFDF9G7sd980G8dfG9FG_aSD650g8dsh7D98g79Fs98ds0788Ps",
      "salesforce_client_secret" => "1234567890123456789",
      "salesforce_username"      => "you@youremail.com",
      "salesforce_password"      => "yourSalesforcePassword",
  ];
  ```

## Salesforce Opportunity CRM Integration<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" /><Badge type="feature" text="2.5.0+" />

:::info
[Click here if you're looking for the Salesforce _Lead_ integration.](#salesforce-lead-crm-integration)
:::

Salesforce _Opportunity_ integration includes support for the following:

- Field mapping to standard and custom _Opportunity_, _Account_ and _Contact_ object fields.
  - There are some limitations to types of fields that can be mapped, such as **Lookup** fields.
- Freeform performs a duplicate check on records in the following way:
  1.  Check mapped Freeform field against _Account_ **Name** field.
      - If no match, create a new Salesforce Account.
  2.  Check mapped Freeform fields against _Contact_ **First Name**, **Last Name** and **Email** fields.
      - If email address exists in Salesforce Contact, update the existing Contact with other details.
      - If no email address match, check if first name and last name exist in Salesforce Contact, then update the existing Contact with all other values including the new email address.
      - If no matches at all, create a new Salesforce Contact.
      - If _Account_ **Name** matched, assign the new Contact to the existing Salesforce Account.
  3.  Create new _Opportunity_.
      - Attach Opportunity to existing or newly created Salesforce Account.
- Freeform will create an _Account_ with the **First Name** and **Last Name** mapped to the _Contact_ if you leave the _Account_ **Name** field empty.
  - This is helpful if you are dealing with customers not necessarily belonging to a company or organization, and just wish to have a Salesforce Account matching the Contact.
