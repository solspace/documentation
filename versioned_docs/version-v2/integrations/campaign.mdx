This documentation page assumes you have read over the [Email Marketing Integration Overview](./index.mdx#email-marketing). If you have not yet read it, please do so now. We also assume that you have the [Craft Campaign plugin](https://craftcampaign.com) installed and setup already. This integration will work with both _Lite_ and _Pro_ editions of Freeform.
