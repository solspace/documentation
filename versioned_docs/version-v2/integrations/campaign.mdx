# Craft Campaign plugin Mailing List Integration<Badge type="feature" text="2.0.0+" />

This documentation page assumes you have read over the [Email Marketing Integration Overview](./index.mdx#email-marketing). If you have not yet read it, please do so now. We also assume that you have the [Craft Campaign plugin](https://craftcampaign.com) installed and setup already. This integration will work with both _Lite_ and _Pro_ editions of Freeform.

Craft Campaign integration includes support for the following:

- Field mapping to regular text field types.

## Setup Instructions
