# dotmailer Mailing List API Integration<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" /><Badge type="feature" text="2.4.2+" />

This documentation page assumes you have read over the [Email Marketing Integration Overview](./index.mdx#email-marketing). If you have not yet read it, please do so now. We also assume that you have a [dotmailer](http://dotmailer.com) account already, along with mailing list(s) already created. This integration requires that you have _Freeform Pro_. If you currently have Freeform Lite, you can purchase an upgrade to Freeform Pro.
