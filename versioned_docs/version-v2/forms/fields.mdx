# Fields & Field Types

Freeform uses its own set of fields and field types. Using a predefined set of fields also gives us the control to more easily account for how each form field should be displayed in Composer's live preview, and provides a smoother experience.

:::warning
There is currently a limit (around 130+) on the number of Freeform fields for each install of Craft, due to the MySQL column limit, since all fields are stored in a single table. However, Freeform fields can be used across all forms, and even be relabelled for each form.

## Fields Overview

Fields are global and available to all forms, but they can also be overwritten per form. This allows you to save time reusing existing fields when making other forms, but also gives you flexibility to make adjustments to them when needed. So to clarify, you can create fields with labels and options that are common to all forms, but also override those on each form. For example, if you have a field named **Cell Phone**, on the form level, you can rename the field name to **Mobile Phone**, or if you have a Checkbox Group field with options: **Option 1**, **Option 2**, and **Option 3**, you could override it to just have 2 options with values of **Option A** and **Option B**. When the fields are edited at global level (in main Fields area of Freeform control panel), your customizations per form will NOT be lost.

Fields can be created and managed in the main field creation area (**Freeform > Fields > New Field**) and can also be created directly within the _Composer_ interface as well. Fields created here are available globally as well (they do not just exist for that form).

<Photo img={QuickFieldsPhoto} alt="Composer - Quick Create Fields" />

Select, Multiple Select, Checkbox Group and Radio Group fields can also be automatically populated with select [Craft Elements or Pre-defined list options](#populating-fields-with-elements-predefined-options).

All fieldtypes conveniently include the ability to set attributes for their **labels**, **inputs**, **errors** and **instructions** directly inside the Composer property editor. This allows you to keep your hands clean of being inside formatting templates and specify one-off exceptions for fields such as `readonly` and `autocomplete="off"`, etc.

- To use single attributes like `novalidate`, just enter the attribute in the **Attribute** column and leave the **Value** column empty.
- You can use anything inside the [Form](../templates/objects/form.mdx) and [Field](../templates/objects/field.mdx) objects as well, e.g.:
  _ `{{ field.id }}` to access Field ID.
  _ `{{ form.handle }}` to access form handle.

  alt="Composer - Field Attributes Editor"
/>

**Important Notes:**

- All field properties can be overwritten at form level inside Composer, including the field Handle.
- Once a field is created, you cannot change the field type after.
- Freeform will load fields of [Hidden](#fields-hidden) type at the beginning of the form, regardless of where they are placed in Composer layout.

## Field Types

The following field types are available ([see below for additional Pro Field Types](#pro-field-types)):

- **Text** <a href="#fields-text" id="fields-text" class="docs-anchor">#</a>
  - A simple input field.
    - Can be marked as required.
    - Can contain default text and/or placeholder.
    - Can set `maxlength` property.
  - View [field specific properties for templating](../templates/objects/field#field-text).
- **Textarea** <a href="#fields-textarea" id="fields-textarea" class="docs-anchor">#</a>
  - A simple multi-line input field.
    - Specify the number of rows the textarea should have.
    - Can be marked as required.

## Special Fields

Special fields are ones that either every form needs (such as Submit button), ones that assist in setting up form behaviors (such as Confirm and Password), and ones that aid in the layout and content of forms (such as the HTML block). None of these fields store any submission data in the database. The following special fields are available to use:

- **Submit** <a href="#fields-submit" id="fields-submit" class="docs-anchor">#</a>
  - Settings allow you to edit the button label.
  - You may adjust the positioning of the submit button:
    - Aligned to Left
    - Aligned to Center
    - Aligned to Right
  - When using with multi-page forms, Freeform will detect when you're on a page after first page, and provide you with additional options:
    - It will include a Previous button by default, allowing the user to go back to previous pages in the form.
      - Previous button can be disabled.
    - Positioning options now include:
      - Apart at Left and Right
      - Together at Left
      - Together at Center
      - Together at Right
  - You may include 1 per page in your form.
- **HTML** <a href="#fields-html" id="fields-html" class="docs-anchor">#</a>
  - Property Editor will load an HTML area for you to type or paste your code into.
  - Layout column will live parse your HTML.
  - All HTML is allowed here.
  - You can include as many of these in your form as you wish.
- **Confirm** <Badge type="feature" text="Improved in 2.2.0" /> <a href="#fields-confirm" id="fields-confirm" class="docs-anchor">#</a>
  - Allows you to force a user to enter a matching value for another field, including [Password](#fields-password) special field (e.g. "Confirm Email Address").
    - Select a target field to compare with.
    - Can be marked as required.
    - Can contain default text and/or placeholder.
- **Password** <Badge type="feature" text="2.2.0+" /> <a href="#fields-password" id="fields-password" class="docs-anchor">#</a>
  - Allows you to collect a password from a submitter, **but NOT store the value in the database**.
    - Useful for [creating a user registration form](../guides/speciality-forms/user-registration-forms.mdx) (using the [Element Connections](./element-connections) feature) and in other very specific use-cases where you're passing the password off somewhere else.
    - Collected data is not stored in Freeform anywhere, nor is it included in the Submission object or `allFields` variable in [email notifications](./email-notifications#all-fields).
    - When using with Users [Element Connections](./element-connections) feature, the password will be passed off to Craft's [Users](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/users.html) member account feature.
    - Can be marked as required.
    - Can contain default text and/or placeholder.
- **reCAPTCHA** <Badge type="pro" text="Pro" /> <a href="#fields-recaptcha" id="fields-recaptcha" class="docs-anchor">#</a>
  - Built in support for [reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha.mdx).
  - See [reCAPTCHA documentation](./spam-protection#recaptcha) for more information.
  - _reCAPTCHA_ fields will render automatically like the rest of your fields in your form, but if you're building a form manually, you'd call it like this (using the Hash value for _reCAPTCHA_ field in Property Editor of Composer):

```twig showLineNumners
{% set form = craft.freeform.form("composerForm") %}
{% set recaptcha = form.get("JDGnlp8vB") %}
{{ recaptcha.renderInput }}
```

- If you're loading an entire form via AJAX, you'll need to load the reCAPTCHA JS yourself, since it's considered insecure otherwise and the browser blocks it. You should add this script tag anywhere on your page, preferably the footer:

```html showLineNumbers
<script
  type="text/javascript"
  src="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js?render=explicit"
></script>
```
