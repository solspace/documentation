# Mailchimp Integration

This documentation page assumes you have read over the [Email Marketing Integration Overview](./index.mdx#email-marketing). If you have not yet read it, please do so now. We also assume that you have a [Mailchimp](http://mailchimp.com) account already, along with mailing list(s) already created. This integration requires that you have _Freeform Pro_. If you currently have Freeform Lite, you can purchase an upgrade to Freeform Pro.

MailChimp integration includes support for the following:

- Field mapping to standard and custom fields (of text type only), per list.
