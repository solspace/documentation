# Salesforce Lead CRM API Integration

This documentation page assumes you have read over the [CRM Integration Overview](./index.mdx#crm). If you have not yet read it, please do so now. We also assume that you have a [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com) account already. This integration requires that you have _Freeform Pro_. If you currently have Freeform Lite, you can purchase an upgrade to Freeform Pro.

Salesforce integration includes support for the following:

- Field mapping to standard and custom _Lead_ object fields:
  - Text fields:
    - String
    - Textarea
    - Email
    - URL
    - Address
    - Picklist
    - Multipicklist
  - Numeric fields:
    - Number
    - Phone
    - Currency
  - There are some limitations to types of fields that can be mapped, such as **Lookup** fields.
- Available fields are pulled from the _Lead_ object in Salesforce, which is located at:
  1.  **Setup** (top right)
  2.  **Objects & Fields** (left nav)
  3.  **Object Manager**
  4.  **Lead**
  5.  **Fields & Relationships** (top middle menu)

### Setup Instructions

<StepMarkdown>

#### Prepare Salesforce's end for Integration

    * Open another browser tab and go to [Salesforce website](https://login.salesforce.com) and log into your account.
    * On the left navigation menu, click on **Apps**, then click **App Manager**.
    * At the top right corner of the page, click the **New Connected App** button.
    * Fill out the fields in the **Basic Information** section.
    * In the **API (Enable OAuth Settings)** section, click the **Enable OAuth Settings** checkbox.
    * More fields will appear. In the **Callback URL** field, enter any valid URL that begins with **https** (it could even be **https://google.com**, as we don't use this part).
    * In the **Selected OAuth Scopes** field, select the following permissions from the list and click **Add** arrow button:
    	* **Allow access to your unique identifier (openid)**
    	* **Perform requests on your behalf at any time (refresh_token, offline_access)**
    * You shouldn't need to fill out any further fields, and then click **Save** button.
    * You will be taken to a new page that lists info about your newly created app, including **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret** values. You will need to copy each of these values.
    	* Salesforce gets tricky to navigate, so do yourself a favor and copy and paste these 2 values into a text editor for now, being sure to label each too. You'll save yourself some extra steps later on.
    * At the top middle of the page, click on the **Manage** button.
    * At the top middle of the next page, click the **Edit Policies** button.
    * Under the **OAuth policies** section, adjust the following settings:
    	* In the **Permitted Users** field, be sure that it is set to **All users may self-authorize**.
    	* In the **IP Relaxation** field, change the setting to **Relaxed IP restrictions**.
    	* Click **Save** button at bottom of page.
    * If you copy and pasted the **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret** values in a text editor, you can skip these next couple steps:
    	* To go back to your app to see these values, click on the **App Manager** navigation item (under **Apps**)
    	* Find your app in the list. Then in the right column, click the down arrow, and then click **View**.

#### Prepare your site's end for Integration

    * Copy the **config.php** file located in the **/craft/plugins/freeform/** directory, and paste it in the **/craft/config/** directory. Then rename the file to **freeform.php**.
    * Replace the `null` value for **salesforce_client_id** with the Salesforce **Consumer Key** value.
    * Replace the `null` value for **salesforce_client_secret** with the Salesforce **Consumer Secret** value.
    * Replace the `null` value for **salesforce_username** with your Salesforce account username/email address.
    * Replace the `null` value for **salesforce_password** with your Salesforce account password.
    * Save the changes in the **freeform.php** file.
    * Your final file should look something like this:

```php showLineNumbers
  <?php

  return array(
      "salesforce_client_id"     => "7SDf7GFDG6O76sd798FdG98s9897F9G7dSFDF9G7sd980G8dfG9FG_aSD650g8dsh7D98g79Fs98ds0788Ps",
      "salesforce_client_secret" => "1234567890123456789",
      "salesforce_username"      => "you@youremail.com",
      "salesforce_password"      => "yourSalesforcePassword",
  );
```

#### Verify Authorization
