# HubSpot CRM API Integration

This documentation page assumes you have read over the [CRM Integration Overview](./index.mdx). If you have not yet read it, please do so now. We also assume that you have a [HubSpot](http://hubspot.com) account already. This integration requires that you have _Freeform Pro_. If you currently have Freeform Lite, you can purchase an upgrade to Freeform Pro.

HubSpot integration includes support for the following:

- Field mapping to standard and custom fields from all 3 endpoints listed below (of text/number string type only).
- Maps data to [Deals](http://developers.hubspot.com/docs/methods/deals/deals_overview) (optional), [Contacts](http://developers.hubspot.com/docs/methods/contacts/contacts-overview) and [Companies](http://developers.hubspot.com/docs/methods/companies/companies-overview) API endpoints.
