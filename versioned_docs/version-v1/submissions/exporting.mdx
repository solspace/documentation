# Exporting

Freeform includes 3 options for exporting (2 of which are Pro only):

## Quick Export<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

Freeform Pro's Quick Export feature displays inside the Submissions page of the Freeform control panel. Clicking the _Quick Export_ button at the top of the page allows you to export all submissions for a given form, in your choice of **Excel**, **CSV**, **JSON**, **XML** or **Text**. You can then exclude whichever fields you don't want exported.

## Export Profiles<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

Freeform Pro's Export Profiles feature allows admins to create more complex pre-defined export profiles that can be run by any user with proper permissions at any time. Options for export profiles are as follows:

- **Statuses**
  - Select which statuses, if any, to filter the results by.
- **Date Range**
  - Select a date range, if any, you want the results limited by. Current options are:
    - None
    - Today
    - Yesterday
    - Last 7 days
    - Last 30 days
    - Last 365 days
- **Limit**
  - Maximum number of submissions the export should generate.
- **Fields to Export**
  - Select the fields you'd like to be included and rearrange their order.
- **Filters**
  - Add filters to narrow down your results.
  - Select a field name and check if it's **Equal to** / **Not equal to** / **Like** a value specified.
  - Specify as many filters as you wish.
