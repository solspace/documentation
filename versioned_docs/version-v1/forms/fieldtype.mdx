# Element Field Types

Freeform includes 2 field types:

- _Freeform Forms_ - allows you to assign/relate forms to other element types such as Entries.
- _Freeform Submissions_ - allows you to assign/relate form submissions to other element types such as Entries.

Here's an overview on how to use these field types:

### Creating the Field

Creating a Freeform Form field is done just like any other fieldtype, here's an overview of the process:

<VerticalStepWrapper>
<StepMarkdown>
Go to the **Settings** area in Craft control panel. Click on **Fields**.

Click the **New field** button in the top right corner.

</StepMarkdown>

<StepMarkdown>
Name the field as you wish. For example: *Related Form* with a handle of `relatedForm`.
</StepMarkdown>
<StepMarkdown>

For the **Field Type** option, select _Freeform Form_ or _Freeform Submissions_ from the list.

**Selection Label** is the text that will appear on the button which opens the Freeform Form selection pop-up dialog.

</StepMarkdown>
<StepMarkdown>
Click the **Save** button in the top right corner to save the new field.

</StepMarkdown>
</VerticalStepWrapper>

Your Freeform Form field is now available to be assigned to other sections.

### How it Works

The Freeform _Form_ fieldtype lets the user assign any Freeform form to any element: a section Entry, Categories, Assets, etc.

### Template Properties

The following are template properties are available for the _Form_ fieldtype:

- `name` <a href="#param-name" id="param-name" class="docs-anchor">#</a>
  - Outputs the name of the form
- `handle` <a href="#param-handle" id="param-handle" class="docs-anchor">#</a>
  - Outputs the handle of the form
- `id` <a href="#param-id" id="param-id" class="docs-anchor">#</a>
  - Outputs the unique ID of the form
- `description` <a href="#param-description" id="param-description" class="docs-anchor">#</a>
  - Outputs the description of the form
- `render()` <a href="#param-render" id="param-render" class="docs-anchor">#</a>
  - Outputs the full form, rendering it with the [Formatting Template](../templates/) specified in the form builder for the form.

## Examples

### Freeform Form Field in Entries

An example of template code you would use to display a Freeform form (with field handle of _myFreeformFieldName_) that is attached to a Craft Entry would look something like this:

```twig {5-8} showLineNumbers
{% for entry in craft.entries.section('news').limit(10) %}
    <div class="entry">
        <h2><a href="{{ entry.url }}">{{ entry.title }}</a></h2>
        {{ entry.summary }}
        {% if entry.myFreeformFieldName is defined and entry.myFreeformFieldName is not empty %}
            <h3>{{ entry.myFreeformFieldName.name }}</h3>
            {{ entry.myFreeformFieldName.render() }}
        {% endif %}
    </div>
{% endfor %}
```

If you'd like to automatically pass content from another element (such as a Craft Entry) into Freeform field(s), you'd have to use the [overrideValues](../templates/objects/form#prop-custattr-overridevalues) property inside your formatting template.

For example, if you want to pass a title of an entry to a Freeform field, and the entry slug was in the second segment of your URL, you should set that in your formatting template. Also be sure to include a hidden Freeform field in your form (in this case called `entryTitle`). Your formatting template code might look something like this:

```twig showLineNumbers
{% set entry = craft.entries.slug(craft.request.getSegment(2)).first() %}

{{ form.renderTag({
    overrideValues: { entryTitle: entry.title }
}) }}
```

Below is example code for displaying form submissions that have been attached to a blog entry (from a field called **formSubmissions**).

```twig showLineNumbers
{% set blogs = craft.entries.section("blog").limit(20) %}

{% for blog in blogs %}
    <h2>{{ blog.title }}</h2>
    <ul>
    {% for submission in blog.formSubmissions %}
        <li>{{ submission.title }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>
{% endfor %}
```
