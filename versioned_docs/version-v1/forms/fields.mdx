# Fields & Field Types

Freeform uses its own set of fields and field types. Using a predefined set of fields also gives us the control to more easily account for how each form field should be displayed in Composer's live preview, and provides a smoother experience.

:::warning
There is currently a limit (around 130+) on the number of Freeform fields for each install of Craft, due to the MySQL column limit, since all fields are stored in a single table. However, Freeform fields can be used across all forms, and even be relabelled for each form.
:::

## Fields Overview

Fields are global and available to all forms, but they can also be overwritten per form. This allows you to save time reusing existing fields when making other forms, but also gives you flexibility to make adjustments to them when needed. So to clarify, you can create fields with labels and options that are common to all forms, but also override those on each form. For example, if you have a field named **Cell Phone**, on the form level, you can rename the field name to **Mobile Phone**, or if you have a Checkbox Group field with options: **Option 1**, **Option 2**, and **Option 3**, you could override it to just have 2 options with values of **Option A** and **Option B**. When the fields are edited at global level (in main Fields area of Freeform control panel), your customizations per form will NOT be lost.

Fields can be created and managed in the main field creation area (**Freeform > Fields > New Field**) and can also be created directly within the _Composer_ interface as well. Fields created here are available globally as well (they do not just exist for that form).

Some important notes:

- All field properties can be overwritten at form level inside Composer, including the field Handle.
- Once a field is created, you cannot change the field type after.
- Freeform will load fields of [Hidden](#fields-hidden) type at the beginning of the form, regardless of where they are placed in Composer layout.

## Field Types

The following field types are available ([see below for additional Pro Field Types](#pro-field-types)):

- **Text** <a href="#fields-text" id="fields-text" class="docs-anchor">#</a>
  - A simple input field.
    - Can be marked as required.
    - Can contain default text and/or placeholder.
    - Can set `maxlength` property.
  - View [field specific properties for templating](../templates/objects/field.mdx#field-text).
- **Textarea** <a href="#fields-textarea" id="fields-textarea" class="docs-anchor">#</a>
  - A simple multi-line input field.
    - Specify the number of rows the textarea should have.
    - Can be marked as required.
    - Can contain default text and/or placeholder.
    - Can set `maxlength` property.
  - View [field specific properties for templating](../templates/objects/field.mdx#field-textarea).
- **Email** <a href="#fields-email" id="fields-email" class="docs-anchor">#</a>

  - An input field that is flagged in Freeform to expect an email address value as well as possibility for receiving email notifications.
    - In the Property Editor (right column) in Composer, select a notification template if you want the email entered for this field to receive an email notification.
      - Users/groups need to have permissions access for **Email Notifications** to create new formatting templates.
    - To allow sending of email notifications to more than 1 email address (e.g. in the case of a "tell-a-friend" type form), you will need to add multiple input fields, each with the input name `email[]`. This approach would require that you code this part manually however.
    - Required field type if you wish for your users to receive an email notification.
    - Required field type if you're using with a Mailing List API integration.
    - Can be marked as required.
    - Can contain default text and/or placeholder.
  - View [field specific properties for templating](../templates/objects/field.mdx#field-email).

- **Hidden** <a href="#fields-hidden" id="fields-hidden" class="docs-anchor">#</a>
  - A hidden field.
    - Can only include text strings at this time (no variables allowed).
      - If you need you pass a value to your hidden field dynamically, you can do so with the `overrideValues` parameter. Ex: `overrideValues: { myFieldname: myvalue }`
    - Cannot be marked as required.
    - Freeform will load fields of this type at the beginning of the form, regardless of where they are placed in Composer layout.
- **Select** <a href="#fields-select" id="fields-select" class="docs-anchor">#</a>
  - A select dropdown menu field.
    - Can specify labels (with values assumed) or labels and values (that differ).
      - To make the first option empty, use **labels and values** approach with first option having **--** or **Please select...**, etc for the label, and leave option blank.
    - Can be marked as required.
    - Can specify default option to be selected.
  - View [field specific properties for templating](../templates/objects/field.mdx#field-select).
- **Checkbox** <a href="#fields-checkbox" id="fields-checkbox" class="docs-anchor">#</a>
  - A single checkbox field.
    - Has a default value of **Yes**, which can be overwritten with any value you want. The front end however, will always display the value as `1`, but upon submission, the value will be switched to the one you have set.
    - Can be marked as required, which would essentially require that this checkbox be checked.
    - Can be checked by default.

- **File Upload** <a href="#fields-file-upload" id="fields-file-upload" class="docs-anchor">#</a>
  - A file upload field, using [Craft Assets](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/assets.html).
    - Can allow a single file or multiple files (applies `multiple` attribute to the single file upload input) to be uploaded.
      - Specify a number larger than `1` in the **File Count** setting to allow multiple files to be uploaded at the same time.

      - If the form is never completed, incomplete submissions are stored for 3hrs, and then are removed (along with the file(s)) after that.
    - Can be marked as required.

      - Emails are never parsed in source code (they're replaced with **0**, **1**, **2**, etc).
