# Multi-Page Forms

Freeform allows for true _multi-page_ forms (a POST submit per page). Here's some important information to know about them:

- Each page is submitted through POST
  - There is no unique URI segment per page at this time.
  - Users cannot jump ahead to different pages, only forward and backward 1 page.
- Sessions for incomplete submissions are stored for 3hrs, and then are removed after that.
- Users can go backward in forms (if enabled).
  - Any data entered into the current page that has NOT yet been submitted "forward" will not be saved when clicking **Previous** submit button. As in, clicking the Previous button will not save any changes you made to that form page.
- If an earlier page contains file upload field(s), files will actually be uploaded before the form is officially submitted.
  - If the form is never completed, the submission clearing (described above) will remove the file after 3hrs.
