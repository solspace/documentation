# Surveys & Polls Form Type <Badge type="addon" text="Add-on" />

Expand the possibilities of Freeform with the _Surveys & Polls_ form type! If you have the _Pro_ edition of Freeform, this is a plug and play feature that instantly adds access to a special reporting area inside the Freeform control panel that allows you to view stats and charts for each field type. The reports can be customized to use different chart types and hide specific fields. You can even generate a PDF exported document to share with other members of your team.

:::info
If you already have some forms used as surveys or polls, simply switch the **Form Type** setting from _Regular_ to _Surveys & Polls_ and you'll instantly and retroactively have reports available for these forms!

## Requirements

Freeform Surveys & Polls has the following requirements:

- [Freeform](../../) 4.0+
  - Either _Lite_ or _Pro_ edition.
- [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com) 4.0+

## Eligible Field Types

While you can certainly use any field type in your survey and poll forms, Freeform will only recognize certain field types to apply special handling for charts and other stats.

| Field Type                                                 | CP Reports | Charts | Average Score\* |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------ | --------------- |
| **Checkbox group**                                         | ✓          | ✓      | ✓               |
| **Radio group**                                            | ✓          | ✓      | ✓               |
| **Select**                                                 | ✓          | ✓      | ✓               |
| **Multiple select**                                        | ✓          | ✓      | ✓               |
| **Opinion scale**                                          | ✓          | ✓      | ✓               |
| **Rating**                                                 | ✓          | ✓      | ✓               |
| **Text** _(includes Email, Number, Phone, Regex, Website)_ | ✓          |        |
| **Textarea**                                               | ✓          |        |

\*Average score available when the field contains only numeric option values, e.g. `1`, `2`, `3`.

There is currently no support for displaying the following field types in reports: Date & Time, Dynamic Recipients, File Upload, File Upload Drag & Drop, Hidden, Invisible, Signature, and Table.

## Dashboard & Reports

The _Surveys & Polls_ area includes a dashboard that is similar to the regular Freeform dashboard, but will only display all forms that belong to the _Surveys & Polls_ form type. This will provide an overview of all available surveys and polls, and you can click on each one to view the results.

<Photo img={SurveyPollsDashboardPhoto} alt="Surveys & Polls Dashboard" />

An individual report page is available for each _Survey & Poll_ form, which will show the results of the survey or poll as a report summary. Applicable field types will appear as charts and graphs, and you'll have the option to change the chart type for each question/field to whatever suits it better (changes are saved and apply to all users). And finally, an option to generate a PDF export is available if you wish to share the results with other team members.

Charts can be used with **Checkbox group**, **Radio group**, **Select**, **Multiple select**, **Opinion scale**, and **Rating** field types. Available chart types are:

- Horizontal Bar
- Vertical Bar
- Pie
- Donut
- Hidden (entire question and results are hidden in report)

Text option display is available for simpler text-based field types, including **Text**, **Textarea**, **Email**, **Number**, **Phone**, **Regex**, and **Website**.

- Text
- Hidden (entire question and results are hidden in report)

## Creating a Survey

With the magnitude of features and options Freeform offers, there isn't any one way to create a survey or poll form. So many approaches are available to you:

- Will this be a single page form or will you break up your surveys into [multiple pages](../builder.mdx#multi-page-forms) so users don't get overwhelmed?
- Which [field types](../fields.mdx) will you use? A wide variety of options are available to suit every kind of question and flow.
- Will you [conditionally show and hide](../conditional-rules.mdx) some questions or skip pages entirely, based on the selection of other fields?
- Does the survey have a [close date](../../submissions/overview.mdx#submission-limits)?

### Create a New Survey

To create a new survey, the process is almost identical to creating a regular form, but be aware of a few things that are necessary for Freeform to properly handle and recognize your survey forms:

- Be sure to have both _Freeform_ and _Freeform Surveys & Polls_ plugins installed on your site.
- Inside the form builder (or form wizard), be sure to set the **Type** setting to _Surveys & Polls_ from the available options.
- For questions you want to show up as charts in reports, stick to using the **Checkbox group**, **Radio group**, **Select**, **Multiple select**, **Opinion scale**, and **Rating** field types.
- For questions you want to show up as text in reports, be sure to use only **Text**, **Textarea**, **Email**, **Number**, **Phone**, **Regex**, and **Website** fields. All other field types such as File Upload, Signatures, etc will not appear in the _Surveys & Polls_ reports area.
- If you want restrict people from submitting the survey more than once, be sure to select an option in the **Limit Form Submission Rate** setting, which is located in the _Validation_ tab.
- If you want to stop people from submitting the survey after a certain date, be sure to specify a date in the **Stop Submissions After** setting, which is located in the _Validation_ tab.

### Convert an Existing Form

To convert an existing form to be a _Surveys & Polls_ form, simply follow the instructions below:

1. Go to the **Forms** page in the Freeform control panel.
2. Click on the form to edit it inside the form builder.
3. Inside the _Form Settings_ tab, change the **Form Type** setting from _Regular_ to _Surveys & Polls_.
4. Save the form.

## Usage in Templates

The `surveyResults` method becomes available for use in your templates though the [Form query](../../templates/queries/form.mdx) query:

- Iterate over all results (`{% for result in form.surveyResults %}`):
  - `votes` - get the total number answers for this field.
  - `skipped` - get the total number of skipped answers for this field.
  - `average` - get the average numeric value across all answers for this field.
    - This will return `null` if any of the answers aren't numeric.
  - `max` - get the highest numeric value this field may contain.
    - Useful when displaying the average answer chosen to be able to show the max value (e.g. `4.3 / 5`)
  - Access `field` object:
    - `field.id`
    - `field.label`
    - etc
  - `breakdown` - access breakdown of answers (`{% for answer in result.breakdown %}`):
    - Limiting and ordering results (typically used for text fields):
      - `breakdown` - will show all responses in order they were added
      - `breakdown(3)` - fetch only the 3 highest ranked answers
      - `breakdown(-3)` - fetch only the 3 lowest ranked answers
      - `breakdown(true)` - order all answers by highest rank
      - `breakdown(false)` - order all answers by lowest rank
    - Properties:
      - `label` - label of the given answer (will use the answer value for text fields).
      - `value` - value of the given answer.
      - `votes` - number of times this answer was selected.
      - `percentage` - calculated percentage of times this answer was selected against all other options.
      - `ranking` - number of the rank for this answer, with `1` being the top answer.

## Examples

The following are several examples of how to iterate over fields' submission data and display survey results for each.

- [Extract Specific Field Results](#extract-specific-field-results)
- [Example with Bootstrap Library](#example-with-bootstrap-library)
- [Example with Chart.js Library](#example-with-chartjs-library)
- [Iterate Over All Field Types](#iterate-over-all-field-types)

### Extract Specific Field Results

The following example will generate survey or poll results for a specific field.

```twig showLineNumbers
{% set form = freeform.form("myFormHandle") %}

{% set field = form.get('myFieldHande') %}
{% set result = form.surveyResults(field) %}

{% for answer in result.breakdown %}
    <h6 class="mt-4">{{ answer.label }} <small>({{ answer.votes }} votes)</small></h6>
    <div class="progress" style="height: 30px;">
        <div class="progress-bar" role="progressbar" style="width: {{ answer.percentage|round(1) }}%" aria-valuenow="{{ answer.percentage|round(1) }}" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100">{% if answer.percentage > '0' %}{{ answer.percentage|round(0) }}%{% endif %}</div>
    </div>
{% endfor %}
```

### Example with Bootstrap Library

The below example uses the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) library to generate charts with your survey or poll questions and responses for all eligible survey/poll field types.

<Photo
  img={TemplatesSurveyPollsReportPhoto}
  alt="Surveys & Polls Template Report"
/>

```twig showLineNumbers
<style>
    .chart-textarea-responses {
        max-height: 300px;
        overflow-y: scroll;
    }
</style>

{% set form = freeform.form("myFormHandle") %}
{% set results = form.surveyResults %}

<h1>Survey Results for <b>{{ form.name }}</b> form</h1>
<p>There are a total of {{ freeform.submissions({form}).count }} responses.</p>

{% for result in results %}
<div class="container">
    {% set field = result.field %}
    <h2>{{ field.label }}</h2>
    <p>
        {{ result.votes }} responses, {{ result.skipped }} skipped
        {% if result.average|length %}
            <br />Average: <b>{{ result.average|round(1) }}</b> / {{ result.max }}
        {% endif %}
    </p>
    {% if field.type not in ["text", "textarea", "email", "phone", "website", "number", "regex"] %}
        {% for answer in result.breakdown %}
            <h6 class="mt-4">{{ answer.label }} <small>({{ answer.votes }} resp.)</small></h6>
            <div class="progress" style="height: 30px;">
                <div class="progress-bar{{ answer.ranking == 1 ? ' bg-danger' }}" role="progressbar" style="width: {{ answer.percentage|round(1) }}%" aria-valuenow="{{ answer.percentage|round(1) }}" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100">{% if answer.percentage > '0' %}{{ answer.percentage|round(0) }}%{% endif %}</div>
            </div>
        {% endfor %}
    {% elseif field.type in ["text", "email", "phone", "website", "number", "regex"] %}
        <p>Top 10 text responses:</p>
        <ul>
        {% for answer in result.breakdown(10) %}
            <li>{{ answer.value }} ({{ answer.votes }})</li>
        {% endfor %}
        </ul>
    {% elseif field.type == "textarea" %}
        <p>Long answer responses (scroll to see all):</p>
        <ul class="chart-textarea-responses">
        {% for answer in result.breakdown %}
            <li>{{ answer.value }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
        </ul>
    {% endif %}
</div>
<hr class="mt-4" />
{% endfor %}
```

### Example with Chart.js Library

The below example uses the [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) library to generate charts with your survey or poll questions and responses for all eligible survey/poll field types.

```twig showLineNumbers
<style>
    .chart-textarea-responses {
        max-height: 300px;
        overflow-y: scroll;
    }
</style>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>

{% set form = freeform.form("myFormHandle") %}
{% set results = form.surveyResults %}

<h1>Survey Results for <b>{{ form.name }}</b> form</h1>
<p>There are a total of {{ freeform.submissions({form}).count }} responses.</p>

{% for result in results %}
<div class="container">
    {% set field = result.field %}
    <h2>{{ field.label }}</h2>
    <p>
        {{ result.votes }} responses, {{ result.skipped }} skipped
        {% if result.average|length %}
            <br />Average: <b>{{ result.average|round(1) }}</b> / {{ result.max }}
        {% endif %}
    </p>
    {% if field.type not in ["text", "textarea", "email", "phone", "website", "number", "regex"] %}
        <canvas id="chart{{ field.handle }}" width="800" height="300"></canvas>
        <script>
            const chart{{ field.handle }}labels = [
            {% for answer in result.breakdown %}
                '{{ answer.label }}',
            {% endfor %}
            ];
            const chart{{ field.handle }}data = {
                labels: chart{{ field.handle }}labels,
                datasets: [{
                label: '{{ field.label }}',
                backgroundColor: 'rgb(255, 99, 132)',
                borderColor: 'rgb(255, 99, 132)',
                data: [
                {% for answer in result.breakdown %}
                    {{ answer.votes }},
                {% endfor %}
                ],
                }]
            };
            const chart{{ field.handle }}config = {
                type: 'bar',
                data: chart{{ field.handle }}data,
                options: {
                    indexAxis: 'x',
                    responsive: false,
                    barThickness: 50,
                    plugins: {
                        legend: {
                            display: false,
                        }
                    },
                    scales: {
                        x: {
                            grid: {
                                display: false,
                            }
                        }
                    },
                }
            };
        </script>
        <script>
            const chart{{ field.handle }} = new Chart(
                document.getElementById('chart{{ field.handle }}'),
                chart{{ field.handle }}config
            );
        </script>
    {% elseif field.type in ["text", "email", "phone", "website", "number", "regex"] %}
        <p>Top 10 text responses:</p>
        <ul>
        {% for answer in result.breakdown(10) %}
            <li>{{ answer.value }} ({{ answer.votes }})</li>
        {% endfor %}
        </ul>
    {% elseif field.type == "textarea" %}
        <p>Long answer responses (scroll to see all):</p>
        <ul class="chart-textarea-responses">
        {% for answer in result.breakdown %}
            <li>{{ answer.value }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
        </ul>
    {% endif %}
</div>
<hr />
{% endfor %}
```

### Iterate Over All Field Types

The following example will iterate over all fields, compatible with _Survey & Polls_ special behavior or not.

```twig showLineNumbers
{% set form = freeform.form("myFormHandle") %}

{% for row in form %}
    <div>
        {% for field in row %}
            {% set results = form.surveyResults(field) %}
            <div>
                <label>{{ field.label }}</label>
                {% if results %}
                    <ul>
                        {% for answer in results %}
                            <li>{{ answer.label }} ({{ answer.votes }})</li>
                        {% endfor %}
                    </ul>
                {% else %}
                    <div>
                        No survey results for this field.
                    </div>
                {% endif %}
            </div>
        {% endfor %}
    </div>
{% endfor %}
```

## Settings

The _Surveys & Polls_ form type offers a handful of settings that help you set defaults and styling for reports. While the settings for _Surveys & Polls_ are available in the main Freeform settings area, they are stored separately in a `freeform-surveys-polls` section of the Craft project config `project.yaml` file.

:::info
This page and its settings all become inaccessible when the Craft `allowAdminChanges` config setting is set to `false`.

## Permissions

The following user / group permissions become available with the _Surveys & Polls_ form type:

- **Access Surveys & Polls**
  - Allow access to the Surveys & Polls dashboard and reports pages.
  - Users will still need valid form permissions to administrate forms and valid submission permissions to view individual survey responses.
  - **Manage Reports**
    - Allow changes to the chart style for each question in Surveys & Polls reports.
