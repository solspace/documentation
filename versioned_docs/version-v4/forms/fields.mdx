# Fields

Freeform features its own set of robust field types. The form builder displays a list of available field types which can then be added to forms indefinitely. Fields are specific to each form, but can also be saved or searched upon to be reused in other forms.

## Overview

### Important Notes

- Only Freeform's field types may be used in forms. Craft fields or custom field types are not supported at this time.
- Fields can be created and managed in the main field creation area (**Freeform > Fields > New Field**) and can also be created directly within the form builder interface as well. Fields created here are available globally as well (they do not just exist for that form).
- When the fields are edited at global level (in main Fields area of Freeform control panel), your customizations per form will NOT be lost.
- Once a field is created, you cannot change the field type after.
- All field properties can be overwritten at form level inside the form builder, including the field Handle.
- All fieldtypes conveniently include the ability to set attributes for their **labels**, **inputs**, **errors** and **instructions** directly inside the form builder property editor.
  - This allows you to keep your hands clean of being inside formatting templates and specify one-off exceptions for fields such as `readonly` and `autocomplete="off"`, etc.
  - To use single attributes like `novalidate`, just enter the attribute in the **Attribute** column and leave the **Value** column empty.
  - You can use anything inside the [Form](../templates/objects/form.mdx) and [Field](../templates/objects/field.mdx) objects as well, e.g.:
    - `field.id` to access Field ID.
    - `form.handle` to access form handle.

### Standard Settings

There is a standard number of settings available to all forms (with some exceptions). Every form field has the ability for you to do the following:

| Setting              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Reset** (button)   | Pressing this will reset the field settings and values back to what is set in the defaults (**Freeform > Fields > New Field**).                                                                           |
| **Handle**           | How the field may be called in templates, if necessary. You may also override this value per form if you wish. Non-fields like HTML blocks will have a hash value that behaves the same as field handles. |
| **Label**            | The label for the field. This can be changed per form if you wish.                                                                                                                                        |
| **Required**         | Mark if the field requires a value to submit the form successfully.                                                                                                                                       |
| **Instructions**     | Specify intructions for the field if you wish.                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Default Value**    | For applicable fields, you can set a default value or selected option for the field.                                                                                                                      |
| **Placeholder**      | Specify placeholder text for the field, if applicable.                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Maximum Length**   | The maximum number of characters for the field's value.                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Attribute Editor** | Apply any kind of attribute on the input, label, error, instruction in Freeform's automated rendering of the form.                                                                                        |

### Populating Field Options

All multi-option field types (such as Dropdown, Checkboxes, etc) can have their option labels and values automatically populated with [Craft Elements or Pre-defined list options](#populating-fields-with-elements--predefined-options).

- [Applicable Field Types](#applicable-field-types)
- [Available Craft Elements](#available-craft-elements)
- [Available Predefined Options](#available-predefined-options)

[Want to display single checkbox fields as a light switch toggle?](../guides/fields/toggle-switch-checkbox)
:::

### Settings

- Specify a value (e.g. `y` or `yes`, etc).
  - Has a default value of **Yes**, which can be overwritten with any value you want. No matter what value is set manually on the front end, Freeform will interpret it as checked and record the value specified in the form builder.
- May be checked by default.

### Templating

- `options` (an array of option objects with `label` and `value` properties)

## Checkbox Group

A group of checkboxes. The `field.type` property value is `checkbox_group` (for conditionals).

- Can specify labels (with values assumed) or labels and values (that differ).
- Can be automatically populated with select [Craft Elements or Pre-defined list options](#populating-fields-with-elements--predefined-options).
- Can be rendered vertically or horizontally.

### Templating

- `options` (an array of option objects with `label` and `value` properties)

## Date & Time <Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

A complex date and/or time field. Can be used as Date only, Time only, or both. Many configuration and validation options available as well. The `field.type` property value is `datetime` (for conditionals).

<Photo scale={40} img={DateTimePhoto} alt="Date & Time field type" />

### Settings

- May contain a default value.
  - You may use `now`, `today`, `5 days ago`, `2017-01-01 20:00:00`, etc, which will format the default value according to the chosen format as a localized value.
- The default Freeform datepicker can be disabled and you can load your own manually in the template if you wish.
  - Freeform will automatically insert javascript in the footer/inside form (depending on settings) of the page for this fieldtype.
- Choose to have your own placeholder or have Freeform generate a placeholder based on the settings below.
- Set the date order formatting you'd like:
  - year month day
  - month day year
  - day month year
- Select if the year should be displayed/validated as 4 digits.
- Select if the day and month numbers should have a leading `0` for single digit values (e.g. August will display as `08` instead of `8`).
- Choose the date separator character used between each year, month, day value:
  - None
  - Space (` `)
  - `/`
  - `-`
  - `.`
- Select if time and datepicker should use 24 hour clock.
- Choose the clock separator character used to separate hours and minutes:
  - None
  - Space (` `)
  - `:`
  - `-`
  - `.`
- Choose if placeholder should separate AM/PM with a space (for 12hr clock).
- Select the Min and Max dates for the date picker and validation (optional). Use static dates (e.g. `2018-11-01`, `2018-11-30`) or relative date strings (e.g. `-10 days`, `+3 months`).

### Notes

- For **localization** reference:
  - The _Flatpickr_ date picker will automatically localize according to the locale set for your site. Locales available are only 2-letter codes like `fr`, `de`, etc. In the event you're using a locale like `fr-CA` or `es-US`, etc, Freeform will just look at the first 2 letters and use that as the locale.
  - To translate the formatting syntax error message, be sure to translate the following strings:
    - `"{value}" does not conform to "{format}" format.`
    - To translate the `{format}` rendered value to match the current locale, be sure to also translate whatever the rendered string is in the error message. For example, if you're using `fr` locale, and wish to have the default English `DD/MM/YYYY` show up as `JJ/MM/AAAA`, create a static translation for this manually.
- To customize the date picker appearance and behavior, please see [Date Picker Events](../developer/datepicker.mdx) documentation.

### Templating

- `initialValue`
- `dateTimeType` (e.g. `both`)
- `generatePlaceholder` (e.g. `true`)
- `dateOrder` (e.g. `ymd`)
- `date4DigitYear` (e.g. `true`)
- `dateLeadingZero` (e.g. `true`)
- `dateSeparator` (e.g. `/`)
- `clock24h` (e.g. `false`)
- `clockSeparator` (e.g. `:`)
- `clockAMPMSeparate` (e.g. `true`)
- `useDatepicker` (e.g. `true`)
- `minDate` (e.g. `five weeks ago`)
- `maxDate` (e.g. `2024-12-31`)

## Dynamic Recipients

A special field, displayable as a Select, Radio or Checkbox Group that contains protected email addresses and labels for each. The `field.type` property value is `dynamic_recipients` (for conditionals).

<Photo scale={60} img={DynamicRecipientsPhoto} alt="Dynamic Recipients" />

### Settings

- Can specify labels and email address values.
  - Multiple email addresses can be specified for each option, separated by commas.
  - Emails are never parsed in source code (they're replaced with **0**, **1**, **2**, etc).
    - When parsing this field semi-manually, be sure to use `loop.index0` to generate numeric values of options instead of `fieldName.value`.
  - To make the first option empty (when displaying as Select), set the first option having something like **Please select...** for the label, and leave option blank.
- Can be automatically populated with select [Craft Elements or Pre-defined list options](#populating-fields-with-elements--predefined-options).
- Can be switched to display as Radio or Checkbox options at form level inside the form builder.
  - Can be rendered vertically or horizontally.
- Choose an email notification template to be used to send to the option(s) chosen.
  - Users can specify 1 or more recipient options at a time (when using as Checkboxes).
  - Users/groups need to have permissions access for **Email Notifications** to create new formatting templates inside the form builder.

### Notes

- Can include more than 1 of this field type in your forms, allowing for multiple sets of recipients to be notified.
- When parsing this field semi-manually, be sure to use `loop.index0` to generate numeric values of options instead of `fieldName.value`.

:::info
**Make sure that each option value is unique.**

If you're receiving duplicate or multiple email notifications from the Dynamic Recipients field, it's likely because you've specified more than one option with the same email address. This is a current limitation of Freeform, as it will perceive the user submitting all of the matching options at once, sending off emails as many times as there are duplicate options.

The only workarounds for this would be to either:

- Create an email address alias for each option so that each option in the Dynamic Recipients field type settings will be unique.
- Add sub-address tags to the affected email addresses so their values are unique. For example: `joe+whatever@example.com`, `joe+somethingelse@example.com`.
  :::

### Templating

- `showAsRadio`
  - A boolean value. If `true` the dynamic recipients field should be rendered as radio buttons instead of a select field.
- `showAsCheckboxes`
  - A boolean value. If `true` the dynamic recipients field should be rendered as checkboxes instead of a select field.
- `notificationId`
  - The database ID of the assigned Email Notification Template.

## Email

A single-line text input field that includes additional validation to expect a valid email address as well as the possibility of attaching an email notification to it. Pair this with the [Confirm](#confirm) special field type if you wish to have the user enter their email address twice. The `field.type` property value is `email` (for conditionals).

<Photo scale={40} img={EmailPhoto} alt="Email field type" />

:::info
It is required to use the **Email** field type if you wish for your users to receive an email notification when submitting the form and/or you're using an Email Marketing API integration.
:::

:::tip
[Need to prevent users from using certain types of email addresses (e.g. common free ones such as Gmail, Yahoo, etc)?](../guides/form-validation/preventing-email-addresses)
:::

### Settings

- Optionally choose an email notification template to be used to send to the submitter of the form (or the email address entered in this field).
  - Users/groups need to have permissions access for **Email Notifications** to create new formatting templates inside the form builder.

### Templating

- `placeholder`
- `notificationId` (the ID of the assigned email notification template)

## File Upload

A regular file upload field, using [Craft Assets](https://craftcms.com/docs/5.x/reference/element-types/assets.html). The `field.type` property value is `file` (for conditionals).

  - Does NOT work with [Image Transforms](https://craftcms.com/docs/5.x/reference/element-types/assets.html#image-transforms).
  - **Upload Location Subfolder** (optional) - the subfolder path that files should be uploaded to. May contain `form.handle` or `form.id` variables or something like `currentUser.id` for folders based on user ID's or `"now"|date("Y/m")` to dynamically generate folders based on dates as well.
- Define maximum file size (in KB). Default is 2048 KB (2MB). Is subject to:
  - Craft's [maxUploadFileSize](https://docs.craftcms.com/api/v3/craft-config-generalconfig.html#$maxUploadFileSize-detail) setting
  - PHP [memory_limit](http://us3.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.memory-limit)
  - PHP [post_max_size](http://us3.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.post-max-size)
  - PHP [upload_max_filesize](http://us3.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.upload-max-filesize)
- Can allow a single file or multiple files to be uploaded.
  - Specify a number larger than `1` in the **File Count** setting to allow multiple files to be uploaded at the same time.
  - When collecting multiple files, a single input is still displayed, but allows multiple files to be uploaded (applies `multiple` attribute to the single file upload input).
- Select which file types can be uploaded.
  - Leaving all options unchecked will allow ALL file types.

### Notes

- In [multi-page forms](../forms/builder.mdx#multi-page-forms), if an earlier page contains file upload field(s), files will actually be uploaded before the form is officially submitted.
  - If the form is never completed, incomplete submissions are stored for 3hrs, and then are removed (along with the files) after that.
- If you're handling sensitive files, you may wish to choose an Asset volume without public URL's (**Assets in this volume have public URLs** toggle is off).

### Templating

- `fileKinds`
  - An array of allowed file kinds, e.g. `image`, `document`, `audio`, etc.
- `maxFileSizeKB`
  - The numeric representation of the upload limit in kilobytes.

[Would you like to allow more file extensions in file uploads?](../guides/fields/allow-additional-file-extensions.mdx)
:::

### Settings

- Can control the placeholder wording, e.g. `Drag and drop files here, or click to upload`.
- Choose a default style/theme, e.g. `Light` or `Dark`.

- Must have a [Craft Asset](https://craftcms.com/docs/4.x/assets.html) Source location where the file will be uploaded to.
  - Does NOT work with [Image Transforms](https://craftcms.com/docs/4.x/assets.html#image-transforms).
  - **Upload Location Subfolder** (optional) - the subfolder path that files should be uploaded to. May contain `form.handle` or `form.id` variables or something like `currentUser.id` for folders based on user ID's or `"now"|date("Y/m")` to dynamically generate folders based on dates as well.
- Specify the number of files allowed to upload.
- Define maximum file size **per file** (in KB). Default is 2048 KB (2MB). Is subject to:
  - Craft's [maxUploadFileSize](https://docs.craftcms.com/api/v3/craft-config-generalconfig.html#$maxUploadFileSize-detail) setting
  - PHP [memory_limit](http://us3.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.memory-limit)

- Select which file types can be uploaded.
  - Leaving all options unchecked will allow ALL file types.

### Notes

- Unlike the regular [File Upload](#file-upload) field, the **File Upload Drag & Drop** field will remember files that have been uploaded to it regardless of the context: errors upon submission, [multi-page forms](../forms/builder.mdx#multi-page-forms), returning to edit the submission later.
  - If the form is never completed, incomplete submissions are stored for 3hrs, and then are removed (along with the files) after that.
- While files are uploading, Freeform will disable the **Submit** button so that the form has time to finish uploading the files. If the form is submitted while files are still uploading, any that are incomplete will not be saved.
- If you're handling sensitive files, you may wish to choose an Asset volume without public URL's (**Assets in this volume have public URLs** toggle is off). However, please note that image file thumbnails will only be present directly after initial upload. Afterward (error when submitting, multi-page forms, returning to edit) the image thumbnails will no longer be accessible to Freeform.

### Templating

- `fileKinds`
  - An array of allowed file kinds, e.g. `image`, `document`, `audio`, etc.
- `maxFileSizeKB`
  - The numeric representation of the upload limit in kilobytes.
- `fileCount`
  - The maximum number of allowed files to be uploaded.
  - A number larger than `1` will allow multiple files to be uploaded at the same time.

### Customizing the Appearance

The form builder includes some options for controlling basic styling, but you can also customize the appearance of the Drag and Drop File Upload field by using your own CSS. To avoid name collision and have maximum flexibility, the CSS class names use [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) methodology. You will also likely need to specify `!important` for each override to ensure it takes effect.

#### CLASS NAMES<Badge type="feature" text="Renamed in 5.0+" />

Below is a list of all class names listed in SCSS:

```scss showLineNumbers
.freeform-file-dnd__input {
  &__placeholder {

  &__preview-zone {
    &__file-preview {
      &__filename {
      }
      &__filesize {
      }
      &__thumbnail {
        &__extension-label {
        }
        &__remove-button {
        }
        &__errors {
        }
        &__progress {
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### SCSS EXAMPLE

Below is an example with SCSS:

```scss showLineNumbers
.freeform-file-dnd__input {
  background: blue;

  &__preview-zone {
    &__file-preview {
      border: 3px solid grey;

      &__thumbnail {
        border: 1px solid black;
        padding: 5px;

        &__remove-button {
          border-radius: 0;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### CSS EXAMPLE

Below is an example with regular CSS:

```css showLineNumbers
.freeform-file-dnd__input {
  background: blue !important;
  border: 1px solid red !important;
}
.freeform-file-dnd__placeholder {
  font-size: 12px !important;
}

}
.freeform-file-dnd__preview-zone__file-preview__thumbnail__remove-button {
  border-radius: 0 !important;
}
```

## Hidden

:::

### Form Settings

- Can only include text strings at this time (no variables allowed).
  - If you need you pass a value to your hidden field dynamically, you can do so with the `values` parameter. E.g. `values: { myFieldName: "myvalue" }`

### Templating

- `placeholder`

### Notes

- To access hidden fields in GraphQL queries you have to loop through the `form > fields` as they are not added to `form > pages > rows > fields`.

## Invisible<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

A field that allows you to collect hidden data in form submissions without a hidden field being present in the template source code. You might typically use this in conjunction with the `overrideValues` parameter to set a dynamic value into the field. It can also be given a hard coded value inside the Property Editor in the CP form builder interface while building your form.

## Multiple Select

A multiple-select field. The `field.type` property value is `multiple-select` (for conditionals).

                    <input type="radio" name="{{ field.handle }}"
                        value="{{ scale.value }}"
                        id="{{ field.idAttribute }}-{{ index }}"
                        {{ field.value == scale.value ? "checked" }}
                    />
                    <label for="{{ field.idAttribute }}-{{ index }}">

## Rating<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" /><Badge text="Surveys & Polls" type="addon" />

A special field that allows for star ratings using Freeform's built-in CSS. The `field.type` property value is `rating` (for conditionals).
This field type is included automatically with the _Pro_ edition of Freeform.

<Photo scale={25} img={RatingPhoto} alt="Rating field type" />

### Settings

- Set the field's number of stars (`3`-`10`).
- Style the color of the stars for the _unselected_, _hover_ and _selected_ states.

### Templating

- `colorIdle` (e.g. `#ddd`)
- `colorHover` (e.g. `gold`)
- `colorSelected` (e.g. `#f70`)
- `maxValue` (e.g. `5`)

To manually render a Rating field using your own styles, your code might look something like this:

```twig showLineNumbers
{% for i in 1..field.maxValue %}
	<label for="rating-{{ i }}">whatever {{ i }}</label>
	<input type="radio" id="rating-{{ i }}" value="{{ i }}" name="{{ field.handle }}">
{% endfor %}
```

## Regex<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

An input field that is validated based on the specified regex pattern (e.g. `/^[a-zA-Z0-9]*$/`). The `field.type` property value is `regex` (for conditionals).

<Photo scale={30} img={RegexPhoto} alt="Regex field type" />

### Settings

- Specify a required pattern for values to match, e.g. `/^[a-zA-Z0-9]*$/`.
- Set the error message a user will see if an incorrect value is supplied.
  - Any occurrences of `{pattern}` will be replaced with specified regex pattern inside the error message, if any are found.

### Notes

- When needing to use `{}` for attributes in **Regex** fields (such as `pattern`), you will need to specify them differently, as Freeform is built to allow Twig rendering and it'll choke. So for example, if you need to use `[0-9]{4,5}`, change it to:

```twig showLineNumbers
[0-9]{{ '{' }}4,5{{ '}' }}
```

### Templating

- `placeholder`
- `pattern`
- `message`

## Select

A select dropdown menu field. The `field.type` property value is `dropdown` (for conditionals).

<Photo scale={40} img={DropdownPhoto} alt="Dropdown field type" />

### Settings

- Can specify labels (with values assumed) or labels and values (that differ).
  - To make the first option empty, use **labels and values** approach with the first option having something like **Please select...** for the label, and leave option blank.
- Can be automatically populated with select [Craft Elements or Pre-defined list options](#populating-fields-with-elements--predefined-options).

### Templating

- `options` (an array of option objects with `label` and `value` properties)

## Signature<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

A field that allows users to handwrite signatures with their mouse inside your form. The `field.type` property value is `signature` (for conditionals).

<Photo scale={35} img={SignaturePhoto} alt="Signature field type" />

### Settings

- Set the dimensions of the field writing/drawing area.
- Set the border and background colors.
- Set the pen dot size (in pixels) and the color.
- To include ability for a user to click a button to erase their signature and start over, check off the **Show 'Clear' button?** checkbox.

### Notes

- Signatures are stored as an image datapoint value.
- Signatures can be downloaded as JPG or PNG files (from control panel).
- Signatures are excluded from regular exports and the `allFields` loop in email notification templates (since it would just hold an image datapoint value string).
- Signatures can be edited when the form is in edit mode.
- The _Clear_ button can be styled inside the form builder with **Input attributes** area inside the property editor.
- The Signature field, due to it's complexness, cannot easily be manually generated in a form, and is best done with render helpers, e.g. `field.render`.
- There's currently no way to make the signature pad area "responsive" (like setting it to 100% width), as this would be quite difficult to account for with the need to display the signature image in various places, etc.

## Table<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

A field that allows you to collect and handle repeating data. The `field.type` property value is `table` (for conditionals).

<Photo scale={80} img={TablePhoto} alt="Table field type" />

### Settings

- Use the Table Layout area to create columns for the table. Options are:
  - Text
  - Checkbox
    - When using _Checkbox_, specify a value you'd like to represent that checkbox when checked.
  - Select
    - When using _Select_, specify multiples separated by the `;` character, e.g. `apples;oranges:cherries`.
- Check off _Use built-in Table JS?_ checkbox to have Freeform include JS in the form that validates the format and auto-inserts the extra characters like `(`, `-`, `+` etc).

#### Form Rendering

Here's how you can use `field.render` for an automated approach to render your Table field inside your formatting templates:

```twig showLineNumbers
{{ field.render({
   class: "table",
   addButtonLabel: "Add +",
   addButtonClass: "btn btn-sm btn-primary",
   removeButtonLabel: "x",
   removeButtonClass: "btn btn-sm btn-danger",
   tableTextInputClass: "form-control",
   tableSelectInputClass: "form-control",
   tableCheckboxInputClass: "form-check-input"
}) }}
```

For **manual** rendering of the Table field inside your form for full customizability, your code might look something like this:

```twig showLineNumbers
<table class="table">
    <thead>
    <tr>
    {% for column in field.tableLayout %}
        <th>{{ column.label }}</th>
    {% endfor %}
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    {% if field.value is empty %}
        <tr>
		{% for index, column in field.tableLayout %}
			{% set colName = field.handle ~ "[0][" ~ index ~ "]" %}
			<td>
			{% switch column.type|default("text") %}
				{% case "select" %}
					<select name="{{ colName }}">
					{% for option in column.value|default("")|split(";") %}
						<option value="{{ option }}">{{ option }}</option>
					{% endfor %}
					</select>
				{% case "checkbox" %}
					<input type="checkbox" name="{{ colName }}" value="{{ column.value|default("Yes") }}" />
				{% default %}
					<input type="text" name="{{ colName }}" value="{{ column.value|default("") }}" />
			{% endswitch %}
			</td>
		{% endfor %}
        </tr>
    {% else %}
        {% for rowIndex, row in field.value %}
            <tr>
			{% for index, column in field.tableLayout %}
				{% set colName = field.handle ~ "[" ~ rowIndex ~ "][" ~ index ~ "]" %}
				{% set colValue = row[index]|default("") %}
				<td>
					{% switch column.type|default("text") %}
					{% case "select" %}
						<select name="{{ colName }}">
						{% for option in colValue|default("")|split(";") %}
							<option value="{{ option }}"{{ option == colValue ? " selected" }}>{{ option }}</option>
						{% endfor %}
						</select>
					{% case "checkbox" %}
						<input type="checkbox" name="{{ colName }}" value="{{ column.value|default("Yes") }}" {{ colValue ? "checked" }} />
					{% default %}
						<input type="text" name="{{ colName }}" value="{{ colValue }}" />
					{% endswitch %}
				</td>
			{% endfor %}
            </tr>
        {% endfor %}
    {% endif %}
    </tbody>
</table>
```

#### Submission Data

Here's how to render a Table field's data inside the [Submission object](../templates/objects/submission.mdx):

```twig showLineNumbers
<table class="table">
    <thead>
        <tr>
        {% for column in field.tableLayout %}
            <th>{{ column.label|default("-") }}</th>
        {% endfor %}
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    {% for row in submission[field.handle].value %}
        <tr>
        {% for index, column in field.tableLayout %}
            <td>{{ row[index] }}</td>
        {% endfor %}
        </tr>
    {% endfor %}
    </tbody>
</table>
```

A complete example might look like:

```twig showLineNumbers
{% for field in submission %}
    <td>
	{% if field.type == "table" %}
		<table class="table">
			<thead>
				<tr>
				{% for column in field.tableLayout %}
					<th>{{ column.label|default("-") }}</th>
				{% endfor %}
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
			{% for row in submission[field.handle].value %}
				<tr>
				{% for index, column in field.tableLayout %}
					<td>{{ row[index] }}</td>
				{% endfor %}
				</tr>
			{% endfor %}
			</tbody>
		</table>
	{% else %}
		{{ submission[field.handle] }}
	{% endif %}
    </td>
{% endfor %}
```

<Photo scale={60} img={TextFieldPhoto} alt="Text field type" />

:::tip
[Want to display a Text input as a Color Picker?](../guides/fields/color-picker-text.mdx)
:::

### Templating

- `placeholder`

## Textarea

A multi-line text input field. The `field.type` property value is `textarea` (for conditionals).

<Photo scale={50} img={TextareaPhoto} alt="Textare field type" />

:::tip
[Need to display linebreaks for Textarea fields in email notifications or on the front end with a Submissions query?](../guides/templating/line-breaks-in-textarea-fields.md)
:::

:::tip
[Want to allow users to use a rich text editor such as **TinyMCE** on the textarea field?](../guides/fields/tinymce-editor-textarea.mdx)
:::

### Settings

- Can specify the number of rows the textarea should have.

### Templating

- `placeholder`

## Website<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

A `url` type input field that checks to see if the URL specified has valid syntax (`http://`, `https://`, `ftp://`, etc). The `field.type` property value is `website` (for conditionals).

<Photo scale={30} img={WebsitePhoto} alt="Website field type" />

### Templating

- `placeholder`

## Confirm<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

A field that allows you to force a user to re-enter a matching value for another text input field, including [Password](#password) fields (e.g. "Confirm Email Address", "Confirm Password"). It runs through additional validation to make sure field values match. If not, it'll show an error. This field stores the data as well, in case that is important for your site's needs. The `field.type` property value is `confirm` (for conditionals).

<Photo scale={70} img={ConfirmPhoto} alt="Confirm field type" />

### Settings

- Choose a target field to validate against, e.g. **Email** field.
  - Available fields must be of text input type, but don't necessarily need to be of the [Text](#text) field type - you can use with [Email](#email) fields, [Password](#password) special fields, [Phone](#phone) fields, etc.

### Templating

- `placeholder`

## Credit Card<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

When a [Stripe Payments](../integrations/stripe-payments.mdx) integration is configured, a credit card special field type will become available. This is required for _Payments_-enabled forms to collect (but not store) credit card information. The `field.type` property value is `cc_details` (for conditionals).

<Photo
  scale={50}
  img={CreditCardPhoto}
  alt="Stripe Payment field Layout Options"
/>

### Settings

- Choose a target field to validate against, e.g. **Email** field.
  - Available fields must be of text input type, but don't necessarily need to be of the [Text](#text) field type - you can use with [Email](#email) fields, [Password](#password) special fields, [Phone](#phone) fields, etc.

### Templating

- `placeholder`

## HTML

A special field type that allows you include HTML and Twig inside your form layout in the form builder. The `field.type` property value is `html` (for conditionals).

<Photo scale={60} img={HTMLPhoto} alt="HTML field type" />

### Notes

- The Property Editor will load an HTML area for you to type or paste your code into.
- The Layout column in the form builder will live parse your HTML (Twig will not be parse inside the form builder).
- All HTML is allowed here.
- To enable Twig inside this field, turn on the [Allow Twig to be Enabled for each HTML block?](../configuration/settings.mdx#allow-twig-to-be-enabled-for-each-html-block) setting (and decide if you need to enable to the **Render HTML block Twig in isolated mode?** setting as well). Then, you will see an **Allow Twig** checkbox in the property editor column. Check that to allow this HTML block to parse Twig code.
- You can include as many of these in your form as you wish.

#### Displaying Submission Data from Previous Pages

If you'd like to display submission data from previous pages, you can do this by using an HTML block field with Twig code that might look something like this:

```twig showLineNumbers
<ul>
    <li>Name: {{ form.get('firstName').value }} {{ form.get('lastName').value }}</li>
    <li>Email: {{ form.get('email').valueAsString }}</li>
    <li>Home Phone: {{ form.get('homePhone').value }}</li>
    <li>My Radio Field: {{ form.get('myRadioField').value }}</li>
</ul>
```

## Email Marketing<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

<Photo scale={35} img={EmailMarketingPhoto} alt="Mailing list field type" />

:::tip
[Want to display this checkbox as a light switch toggle?](../guides/fields/toggle-switch-checkbox)
:::

### Settings

- Email Marketing / Mailing list integrations appear as a checkbox that can be drag and dropped into the form builder interface (from the bottom left corner):
  - Can be displayed as a single checkbox, or set to be a hidden field (as an automatic opt-in when using specifically for mailing list signups).
  - If you want more than 1 mailing list, you can drag and drop another Mailing List field into your layout (but the checkboxes cannot be displayed as a group, unless you made some manual adjustments to the formatting template to simulate it).
- Label of the checkbox is customizable per form.
- Checkbox can be checked by default.
- You can specify the mailing list to be used for the mailing list integration.
- Your form must include an [Email](#email) field type, which must then be assigned to the **Target Email Field** setting.
- When available, the **Field Mapping** setting allows you to map Freeform fields to available mailing list integration fields.

### Notes

- Email Marketing / Mailing list integrations are globally available to all forms, but are configured per form inside the form builder interface.
- Most - if not all - integrations attempt to map all available fields and custom fields, but some may have limitations if the API is too complex or doesn't allow it.

:::info
While data is passed along to the Email Marketing provider, Freeform does not store whether or not Email Marketing fields were opted in, so CP submission views will not display whether or not the user subscribed.
:::

## Password<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

A special field type that allows you to securely collect a password from a submitter **but NOT store the value in the Freeform database** (typically used for [User Registration forms](../guides/speciality-forms/user-registration-forms.mdx) with the [Elements integration](../integrations/elements.mdx)). Pair this with the [Confirm](#confirm) special field type if you wish to have the user enter their password twice. The `field.type` property value is `password` (for conditionals).

<Photo scale={30} img={PasswordPhoto} alt="Password field type" />

### Notes

- Collected data is not stored in Freeform anywhere, nor is it included in the Submission object or `allFields` variable in [email notifications](../forms/email-notifications/#all-fields).
- When using with the Users [Element integration](../integrations/elements.mdx), the password will be passed off to Craft's [Users](https://craftcms.com/docs/5.x/reference/element-types/users.html) member account feature.

## Captcha

A special field type that displays and handles the [reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha.mdx) or [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com) interaction with the user when the [Checkbox](./spam-protection.mdx) option is enabled and configured for the website. Please note that reCAPTCHA v2 Invisible, reCAPTCHA v3 and hCaptcha Invisble do not require any addition of a special field to the form layout. Freeform will automatically apply that validation and take care of it. The `field.type` property value is `recaptcha` (for conditionals).

<Photo scale={30} img={CaptchaPhoto} alt="reCAPTCHA v2 Checkbox field type" />

### Notes

- See [Captchas documentation](./spam-protection.mdx#captchas) for more information.

### Templating

- When a _reCAPTCHA v2 Checkbox_ or _hCaptcha Checkbox_ field is placed into a form layout in the Freeform form builder, it will render automatically like the rest of your fields. However, if you're building a form manually, you'd call it like this:
  ```twig showLineNumbers
  {% set captcha = form.get('recaptcha') %}
  {{ captcha.renderInput }}
  ```
  - If using an earlier version of Freeform (**pre 3.10.4**), you'll need to use the Hash value for the _Captcha_ field in the Property Editor of the form builder, like this:
    ```twig showLineNumbers
    {% set captcha = form.get("JDGnlp8vB") %}
    {{ captcha.renderInput }}
    ```
- If you're loading an entire form into a remote website page via AJAX, you'll need to load the reCAPTCHA JS yourself, since it's considered insecure otherwise and the browser blocks it. You should add this script tag anywhere on your page, preferably the footer:
  ```twig showLineNumbers
  <script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js?render=explicit"></script>
  ```

## Rich Text<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

A special field type that allows you include rich text inside your form layout in the form builder. The `field.type` property value is `rich-text` (for conditionals).

<Photo scale={60} img={HTMLPhoto} alt="Html field type" />

### Notes

- The Property Editor will load a Rich Text area for you to type into and style as necessary. You can also expand the editor into full mode.
- The Layout column in the form builder will live parse your content.
- You can include as many of these in your form as you wish.

:::tip
[Want to allow front end users to use a rich text editor such as **TinyMCE** on a textarea field?](../guides/fields/tinymce-editor-textarea.mdx)
:::

## Save & Continue Later<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

A special field type that lets you place "save" button(s) inside your form layout in the form builder, allowing users to save their form progress and continue/complete the form later. For more information about this feature, please see the [Save & Continue Later documentation](./save-continue-later.mdx). The `field.type` property value is `save` (for conditionals).

<Photo
  scale={45}
  img={SaveContinueLaterPhoto}
  alt="Save & Continue later field type"
/>

### Settings

- Settings allow you to edit the button label.
- You may adjust the positioning of the submit button:
  - Aligned to Left
  - Aligned to Center
  - Aligned to Right
- A return URL must be configured. This is where the user should be returned to if they click the button.
  - Special `token` and `key` variables are available to include in the return path.
  - The return URL would be wherever you like, and fully customizable. This is where you'd include instructions to the user including a URL for where to return to complete the form later.
- You may optionally specify that an email notification be sent to the user if they click the **Save** button.
  - Choose a special Freeform email notification template.
  - The message of this email notification is completely customizable, but be sure to include instructions to the user including a URL for where to return to complete the form later.
  - Requires targeting of a [Email](./fields.mdx#email) field that will contain the user's email address in order to send the email notification.
    - If the user hasn't yet filled out an email address, the email notification attempt will be suppressed (as there is no field validation to ensure the Email field is fillout out). A good way around this would be to have the first page include basic info like _name_ and _email_ but no option to save the form until the second page.
- You may include 1 per page in your form.

### Templating

- `labelNext`
  - A label for the **Next** button. `Submit` by default.
- `labelPrev`
  - A label for the **Previous** button. `Previous` by default.
- `disablePrev`
  - A boolean value. If `true` the **Previous** button should not be rendered.

## Submit

A special field type that lets you place submit button(s) inside your form layout in the form builder. The `field.type` property value is `submit` (for conditionals).

<Photo scale={20} img={SubmitPhoto} alt="Submit Buttons field type" />

### Settings

- Settings allow you to edit the button label(s).
- You may adjust the positioning of the submit button:
  - Aligned to Left
  - Aligned to Center
  - Aligned to Right
- When using with multi-page forms, Freeform will detect when you're on a page after first page, and provide you with additional options:
  - It will include a **Previous** button by default, allowing the user to go back to previous pages in the form.
    - The **Previous** button can be disabled.
  - Positioning options now include:
    - Apart at Left and Right
    - Together at Left
    - Together at Center
    - Together at Right
- You may include 1 per page in your form.

### Notes

When manually building submit buttons in forms, be sure to include a `data-freeform-action` attribute to it.

The attribute value differs between various types of submit buttons:

- For the regular submit button which advances forms forward, it's value has to be `submit`
- For the back buttons in multi-page forms, the value has to be `back`
- For the [Save & Continue Later](./save-continue-later.mdx) buttons, the value has to be `save`

```html showLineNumbers
<button type="submit" data-freeform-action="submit">Submit</button>
<button type="submit" data-freeform-action="back">Go Back</button>
<button type="submit" data-freeform-action="save">Save & Continue Later</button>
```

### Templating

- `labelNext`
  - A label for the **Next** button. `Submit` by default.
- `labelPrev`
  - A label for the **Previous** button. `Previous` by default.
- `disablePrev`
  - A boolean value. If `true` the **Previous** button should not be rendered.

## Populating Fields with Elements & Predefined Options

Inside the form builder (only), field types with options (such as _Dropdown_, _Radios_, etc) have the ability to be automatically fed options from Craft Elements or Freeform's own predefined options. This allows you to quickly build forms by having fields auto-generated.
