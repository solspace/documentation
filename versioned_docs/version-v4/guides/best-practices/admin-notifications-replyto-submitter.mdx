# Form Submitter's Email Address as the Reply-to Email

It's common to have email notifications for admins appear as if they are from the person who submitted the form. This allows for easy reply via email. However, this can result in the email being marked as spam or other issues, especially if SMTP is being used and the _From_ email address needs to be set to a mailbox on the email server. The best practice is to use the **Reply-to Email** and **Reply-to Name** settings for the [email notification template](../../forms/email-notifications.mdx).

## Instructions

<StepMarkdown>
### Set up 'From Email' and 'From Name'

In your [email notification template](../../forms/email-notifications.mdx), add your site name and email address to the **From Name** and **From Email** settings, respectively. If you're using SMTP and/or a mail service, you'll need to ensure that the email address used exactly matches the email address configured for the [Craft Email Settings](https://craftcms.com/docs/5.x/system/mail.html). This might be something like `noreply@mysite.com`.

To ensure this email address is always correct, you can also specify [Environmental Settings](https://craftcms.com/docs/5.x/extend/environmental-settings.html) or access it via `craft.app.projectConfig`.

You might have something like this:

---

**From Email**

```twig showLineNumbers
{{ craft.app.projectConfig.get('email.fromEmail') }}
```

**From Name**

```twig showLineNumbers
{{ craft.app.projectConfig.get('email.fromName') }}
```

</StepMarkdown>
<StepMarkdown>
### Set up 'Reply-to Email' and 'Reply-to Name' to match the Form Submitter

You can then put the form submitter's name and email address in the **Reply-to Name** and **Reply-to Email** settings. This means that when a site admin receives an email notification of a successful form submission, it'll appear to come from something like `noreply@yoursite.com`, but when they click the _Reply_ button in their email client, it'll automatically reply to the form submitter's email address instead.

To grab the form submitter's name and email address, simply specify the field handles.

You might have something like this:

---

**Reply-to Email**

```twig showLineNumbers
{{ email }}
```

**Reply-to Name**

```twig showLineNumbers
{{ firstName }} {{ lastName }}
```

### Save the Notification Template

Simply save the email notification template and you should be good.

Your template look something like this:

<Photo img={RTE1Photo} alt="Reply to email 1" />

OR

<Photo img={RTE2Photo} alt="Reply to email 2" />

</StepMarkdown>

:::warning
Please make sure your email and name field handles are correctly referenced. If not (or if it varies across forms), your email notifications may fail.
