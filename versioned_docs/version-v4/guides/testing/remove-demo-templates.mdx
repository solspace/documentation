# How to Remove Demo Templates

The [Demo Templates](../../configuration/demo-templates.mdx) are handy when starting out with Freeform or trying to troubleshoot issues, but how do you uninstall them when you're done with them? Just follow the steps below:

## Instructions

<VerticalStepWrapper>
<StepMarkdown>

Go to the Craft **templates** directory and look for the demo templates folder you had it install (e.g. `freeform-demo`). Delete that folder and its contents inside.

<StepMarkdown>

Go to the **assets** directory inside your public web directory and look for a folder with the same name as the templates folder (e.g. `freeform-demo`).

</StepMarkdown>
<StepMarkdown>
Go to the **Routes** area is the Craft control panel (_CP → Settings → Routes_) and remove any routes that Freeform installed. They will all have the same path name as the folders you just removed.
