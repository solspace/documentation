# Passing Dynamic Data to Forms

A common request is how to get dynamic template-level data passed to a Freeform form. Freeform is very capable of handling this thanks to the [overrideValues](../../templates/queries/form#param-overridevalues) parameter available to `freeform.form()`, `form.render()` or `form.renderTag()`, depending on how you're loading your Freeform form.

## Overview

The `overrideValues` parameter allows you to override the value of a Freeform field at the template level, like so:

```twig {4-8} showLineNumbers
{{ craft.freeform.form("myForm", {
    labelClass: "form-label",
    inputClass: "form-control",
    overrideValues: {
        firstName: currentUser.name,
        myHiddenFieldHandle: entry.id,
        anotherField: "something else",
    }
}).render() }}
```

The parameter allows you to override the value inside Text fields, or even pre-select a default option for multi-option field types (specify option values in this case). E.g.:

- `hiddenFieldHandle: entry.id` - pull in an entry ID from a Craft Entry.
- `stateSelect: "AZ"` - pre-select **Arizona** state in a State select field.
- `availability: ["tue", "thu"]` - pre-check **Tuesday** and **Thursday** checkbox options in a checkbox group field type.
- `firstName: currentUser.name` - pull in the currently logged in user's name into the Name field.
- `myCheckbox: true` - pre-check a checkbox.

Depending on what you're wanting to do with the data, you might have parts of your form pre-selected or pre-filled out for the user based on where the form is loaded (part of a Craft entry, etc) or which user is logged in (preloading their user data). Or, it might be something you want to silently collect in a hidden field, like the current URL they're at when submitting the form, etc.

You can also dynamically send email notifications with the [dynamicNotification](../../templates/queries/form#param-dynamicnotification) parameter:

```twig showLineNumbers
dynamicNotification: {
    recipients: ["admin@example.com", "support@example.com"],
    template: "test.html"
}
```

Here's a quick cheatsheet for collecting common bits of information dynamically (though you'll need to make sure the context is correct, e.g. a Craft entry is set in the template in order to collect entry data):

## Logged in User Data

Include data from the logged in user in Freeform form fields:

```twig showLineNumbers
overrideValues: {
    firstName: currentUser.firstName,
    lastName: currentUser.lastName,
    email: currentUser.email,
}
```

## Current URL

Include the current URL in a hidden Freeform field:

```twig showLineNumbers
overrideValues: {
    currentUrl: url(craft.app.request.pathInfo),
}
```

## Entry Data

Include data from a given Craft Entry in Freeform form fields:

```twig showLineNumbers
overrideValues: {
    entryId: entry.id,
    stateSelect: entry.state,
},
dynamicNotification: {
    recipients: entry.contactEmail,
    template: "test.html",
}
```

## URL Tracking Parameters

Store UTM URL tracking parameters in your form submissions:

```twig showLineNumbers
overrideValues: {
    utm_campaign: craft.app.request.getQueryParam('utm_campaign'),
    utm_source: craft.app.request.getQueryParam('utm_source'),
    utm_medium: craft.app.request.getQueryParam('utm_medium')
}
```

Where `utm_campaign`, `utm_source`, and `utm_medium` are the handle names of [Hidden](../../forms/fields.mdx#hidden) fields added to your form layout, and assuming your URL looks something like: `https://mysite.net/contact?utm_campaign=my_campaign&utm_source=google_jobs_apply&utm_medium=organic`

## Manually Pre-define Options

Manually override field options in your Freeform form:

```twig showLineNumbers
overrideValues: {
    availability: ["tue", "thu"],
    stateSelect: "AZ",
    myCheckbox: true,
},
dynamicNotification: {
    recipients: ["admin@example.com", "support@example.com"],
    template: "test.html",
}
```

## Passing Freeform data to another Template Function

If you need to pass a Freeform field value (such as an ID) into another Craft function like `craft.entries` or `craft.users` in email notification templates or elsewhere, be sure to specify the Freeform field as `myFreeformFieldHandle.value`. So for example:

```twig showLineNumbers
{{ craft.users.id(myFFfieldHandle.value).one().name }}
```

OR

```twig showLineNumbers
{% set item = craft.entries.section(â€™section').id(myFFfieldHandle.value).one %}
```
