# Console Commands

Freeform includes several console commands to allow you to run cleanup tasks and other tasks.

## Resave Submissions<Badge type="feature" text="4.1.16+" />

If you need to resave all Freeform submissions, you can do so with the following CLI command: `./craft freeform/submissions/resave`. Most of the arguments available to Craft's `resave/entries` command are available here too, so if you need to also update the Craft Search Index, be sure to add `--update-search-index`.

```sh
php craft freeform/submissions/resave --update-search-index
```

## Purge Commands

### Purge Submissions<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

Allows you to purge all submissions older than a specific number of days. Freeform automatically attempts to execute this service based on the specified number of days for the **Automatically Purge Submission Data** setting.

```sh
./craft freeform/purge/submissions --age-in-days=30
```

### Purge Spam

Allows you to purge all spam submissions older than a specific number of days. Freeform automatically attempts to execute this service based on the specified number of days for the **Automatically Purge Spam Submissions** setting.

```sh
./craft freeform/purge/spam --age-in-days=30
```

### Purge Unfinalized Assets

Allows you to purge all unfinalized assets older than a specific number of minutes. Freeform automatically attempts to execute this service every 3 hours by default.

```sh
./craft freeform/purge/unfinalized-assets --age-in-minutes=180
```

## Field Commands

### Create Fields

Allows you to create new fields from the command line.

- `--label="My Field"` - the name of the field to be created. Handles will automatically be converted as camel case to match, e.g. `myField`.
- `--iterations=5` (optional) - the number of fields you'd like created as this type and set. Additional fields will be automatically suffixed with numbers, e.g. `My Field, My Field 1, My Field 2`.
- `--type=select` - the field type you'd like the new field to be created as. Options are:
  - `checkbox`
  - `checkbox_group`
  - `datetime`
  - `dynamic_recipients`
  - `email`
  - `file`
