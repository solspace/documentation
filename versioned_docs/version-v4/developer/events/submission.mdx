# Submission Events

Hook into Submission events to attach your own logic for when submissions are being created, edited or deleted.

## Before a submission is submitted

This event is called right before the submission is saved to the database.

```php showLineNumbers
use Solspace\Freeform\Services\SubmissionsService;
use Solspace\Freeform\Events\Submissions\SubmitEvent;

Event::on(
  SubmissionsService::class,
  SubmissionsService::EVENT_BEFORE_SUBMIT,
  function (SubmitEvent $event) {
    $form = $event->getForm();
    $submission = $event->getSubmission();

    // Perform manipulations here
  }
)
```

## After a submission is submitted

This event is called right after the submission is saved to the database.

```php showLineNumbers
use Solspace\Freeform\Services\SubmissionsService;
use Solspace\Freeform\Events\Submissions\SubmitEvent;

Event::on(
  SubmissionsService::class,
  SubmissionsService::EVENT_AFTER_SUBMIT,
  function (SubmitEvent $event) {
    $form = $event->getForm();
    $submission = $event->getSubmission();

    // Perform some actions here
  }
)
```

## Before a submission is deleted

```php showLineNumbers
use Solspace\Freeform\Services\SubmissionsService;
use Solspace\Freeform\Events\Submissions\DeleteEvent;

Event::on(
  SubmissionsService::class,
  SubmissionsService::EVENT_BEFORE_DELETE,
  function (DeleteEvent $event) {
    $submission = $event->getSubmission();
  }
)
```

## After a submission is deleted

```php showLineNumbers
use Solspace\Freeform\Services\SubmissionsService;
use Solspace\Freeform\Events\Submissions\DeleteEvent;

Event::on(
  SubmissionsService::class,
  SubmissionsService::EVENT_AFTER_DELETE,
  function (DeleteEvent $event) {
    $submission = $event->getSubmission();
  }
)
```

## Before a submission is updated in CP

```php showLineNumbers
use Solspace\Freeform\Controllers\SubmissionsController;
use Solspace\Freeform\Events\Submissions\UpdateEvent;

Event::on(
  SubmissionsController::class,
  SubmissionsController::EVENT_BEFORE_UPDATE,
  function (UpdateEvent $event) {
    $submission = $event->getSubmission();
  }
)
```

## After a submission is updated in CP

```php showLineNumbers
use Solspace\Freeform\Controllers\SubmissionsController;
use Solspace\Freeform\Events\Submissions\UpdateEvent;

Event::on(
  SubmissionsController::class,
  SubmissionsController::EVENT_AFTER_UPDATE,
  function (UpdateEvent $event) {
    $submission = $event->getSubmission();
  }
)
```

## Process a submission field value <Badge type="feature" text="4.1.12+" />

```php showLineNumbers
use Solspace\Freeform\Controllers\SubmissionsController;
use Solspace\Freeform\Events\Submissions\ProcessFieldValueEvent;

Event::on(
  SubmissionsController::class,
  SubmissionsController::EVENT_PROCESS_FIELD_VALUE,
  function (ProcessFieldValueEvent $event) {
    $field = $event->getField();
    $value = $event->getValue();

    $event->setValue($value);
  }
)
```
