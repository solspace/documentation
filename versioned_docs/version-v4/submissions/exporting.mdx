# Exporting

Freeform includes a variety of options for exporting:

## Quick Export<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

Freeform Pro's Quick Export feature displays inside the Submissions page of the Freeform control panel. Clicking the _Quick Export_ button at the top of the page allows you to export all submissions for a given form, in your choice of **Excel**, **CSV**, **JSON**, **XML** or **Text**. You can then exclude whichever fields you don't want exported.

File Upload fields will export as a complete URL to the file if a public URL is specified for the Asset. If not, it will just export as the file name only (e.g. `my-precious.gif`).

## Export from Dashboard

Freeform includes a simple Export dropdown for each form inside the Freeform control panel dashboard. Clicking the _Export..._ dropdown and selecting the file type will generate a complete export of all submissions for that form.

Options available are:

- **Excel** <Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />
- **CSV**
- **JSON** <Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />
- **XML** <Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />
- **Text** <Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

## Export Profiles<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

Freeform Pro's Export Profiles feature allows admins to create more complex pre-defined export profiles that can be run by any user with proper permissions at any time. Options for export profiles are as follows:

- **Name**
  - Create an intuitive name of the profile that is easy for your clients / administrators to figure out.
- **Statuses**
  - Select which statuses, if any, to filter the results by.
- **Date Range**
  - Select a date range, if any, you want the results limited by. Current options are:
    - None
    - Custom Range
      - Range Start (an exact date (e.g. `2020-09-01`) or use something relative like `15 days ago`. Default is `today`.
      - Range End (an exact date (e.g. `2020-09-30`) or use something relative like `15 days ago`. Default is `today`.
    - Presets
      - Today
      - Yesterday
      - Last 7 days
      - Last 30 days
      - Last 365 days
- **Limit**
  - Maximum number of submissions the export should generate.
- **Fields to Export**
  - Select the fields you'd like to be included and rearrange their order.
- **Filters**
  - Add filters to narrow down your results.
  - Select a field name and check if it's **Equal To** / **Not Equal To** / **Like** / **Not Like** a value specified. - When searching on wildcards, use **Like** or **Not Like** and the `%` symbol, e.g. `cat%` will return values like `cat`, `catsup`, and `category`. - For searching into arrays (_Checkboxes_ fields), use **Like** or **Not Like**, quotes, and wrap values with `%`, e.g. `%"option a"%`.
  - Specify as many filters as you wish.

:::info
When searching on fields that contain an array of values (such as Checkboxes fields, etc), the data will be stored in the database like `["whatever","else"]`, so doing a search on `whatever` will never return any results. In this case, you'll need to use the following syntax: `%"whatever"%`.
:::

File Upload fields will export as a complete URL to the file if a public URL is specified for the Asset. If not, it will just export as the file name only (e.g. `my-precious.gif`).

Once export profile(s) exist, users with proper permissions can export submissions in their choice of **Excel**, **CSV**, **JSON**, **XML** or **Text**.

## Export Email Notifications<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

To be used in conjunction with Export Profiles, you can automate email notifications containing export files to be generated and sent to email address(es) of your choice.

- **Name**
  - What this export notification will be called in the control panel.
- **Export Profile**
  - Choose the Export Profile to use for this notification.
- **File Type**
  - Choose the export file type to use for this notification:
    - **Excel**
    - **CSV**
    - **JSON**
    - **XML**
    - **Text**
- **Frequency**
  - Specify how often and which days (if applicable) you'd like to receive the email notifications. The chosen date will attempt to send a notification in the morning (around 6am):
    - **Daily**
    - **Weekly on Sundays**
    - **Weekly on Mondays**
    - **Weekly on Tuesdays**
    - **Weekly on Wednesdays**
    - **Weekly on Thursdays**
    - **Weekly on Fridays**
    - **Weekly on Saturdays**
- **Emails to Notify**
  - Enter the email address(es) that should be notified. If more than one, enter each one on a new line.
- **File Name**
  - The file name to be generated for the export. You can use the `form`, `profile` and `date` objects as a Twig template here to name your file. The extension will be added automatically. E.g. to generate a filename of `some-form-handle-2022-01-01.csv`, use:
    ```
    {{ form.handle }}-{{ date.toDateString }}
    ```
- **Email Subject**
  - The subject line for the email notification.
- **Email Message**
  - The plain text content of the email notification.

## Basic CSV Export

The Express and Lite versions of Freeform include basic **CSV** exporting functionality.

:::info
This basic CSV export is currently limited by pagination. If you have more than 1 page of submission data, selecting the "Select All" checkbox at the top will only select the entire page's results, not results beyond the page currently being viewed. If you have a large number of submissions and need to export them all in a more robust manner, consider switching to the _Pro_ edition for more export options.
:::

To export a selection of your Freeform submissions:

- Select a Form name from the left sub navigation menu
  - You currently cannot export while in **All Submissions** view)
- Select the submissions you wish to export (or click select all checkbox at top).
- In the settings cog icon button at the top, click it and select **Export to CSV**.

File Upload fields will export as a complete URL to the file if a public URL is specified for the Asset. If not, it will just export as the file name only (e.g. `my-precious.gif`).

For more advanced and flexible exporting options, consider upgrading to Freeform Pro.
