When running into issues with Freeform, it can particularly be helpful when contacting Solspace Support (by just taking a screenshot of it), as it provides a glimpse of your setup and amount of data.

- Blocked spam submissions
  - Counts can be reset per form in **Freeform > Forms** page.
- Total number of forms
- Total number of form fields
- Total number of email notification templates
