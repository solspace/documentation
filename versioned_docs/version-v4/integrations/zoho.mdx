## Zoho Deal CRM Integration

This documentation page assumes you have read over the [CRM Integration Overview](./index.mdx#crm). If you have not yet read it, please do so now. We also assume that you have a [Zoho CRM](https://crm.zoho.com) account already. This integration requires that you have _Freeform Pro_. If you currently have Freeform Lite, you can purchase an upgrade to Freeform Pro.
