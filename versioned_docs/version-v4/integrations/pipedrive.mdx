:::info
If you want to specify which user and/or deal stage the leads go into, you can specify the unique ID's for each of those in the **User ID** and **Stage ID** fields, but this is optional. There seems to be no visual way in Pipedrive to see what the ID's are, so you'll likely need to do something like right-clicking on a Stage name / User name link to view the ID in a URL. So for example, to get the Stage ID, go to the **Settings** area and click on **Pipelines**. Right-click on a stage name and copy the link. You'll get something like (where `3` is the stage ID in this case):

`https://yourcompany.pipedrive.com/stages/edit/3.json`

The stage ID is unique, so Pipedrive will automatically know which pipeline you're referring to when you specify the stage ID.
