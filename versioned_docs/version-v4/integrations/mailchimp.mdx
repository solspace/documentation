# Mailchimp Integration<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

This documentation page assumes you have read over the [Email Marketing Integration Overview](./index.mdx#email-marketing). If you have not yet read it, please do so now. We also assume that you have a [Mailchimp](http://mailchimp.com) account already, along with mailing list(s) already created. This integration requires that you have _Freeform Pro_. If you currently have Freeform Lite, you can purchase an upgrade to Freeform Pro.

## Compatibility

Mailchimp integration includes support for field mapping to standard and custom fields of the following types:

- Text
- Website
- URL
- Dropdown
- Radio
- Date
- Zip
- Tags ([see below for details](#additional-features))
- Interests/Groups ([see below for details](#additional-features))
- GDPR consent / Marketing settings ([see below for details](#additional-features))

## Additional Features

The Mailchimp email marketing integration also allows support for _Contact Tags_, individual _Interests/Groups_ and _GDPR consent / Marketing settings_.

- To map _Contact Tags_, in the **Tags** field mapping area in the form builder for the form, select a Freeform field that will contain Tag value(s). This could be a select dropdown, a checkbox group, radio field, hidden field, etc. When specifying multiples, separate by comma.
  - By default, the Mailchimp integration will replace/overwrite any existing Contact Tags if it finds an existing contact for the email address in Mailchimp. If you'd like it to append/add to the existing Contact Tags instead, enable the **Append Mailchimp Contact Tags on update instead of overwriting?** setting inside the integration settings.<Badge type="feature" text="4.0.24+" />
- To map a _Contact Interest/Group_, in the **Group or Interest** field mapping area in the form builder for the form, select a Freeform field that will contain an Interest/Group name value(s). This could be a select dropdown, a checkbox group, radio field, hidden field, etc.
  - Values are case-sensitive and should be entered exactly as it is in Mailchimp, e.g. `My Group Name`.
  - It can accept more than one group.<Badge type="feature" text="4.1.4+" />
- To map _GDPR consent / Marketing settings_ options, in the **GDPR** field mapping area in the form builder for the form, select the Freeform field(s) which will represent opting into the corresponding options. ANY value included in these will be considered an opt-in (regardless of whether it's `yes` or `y`, etc). You will need to map a field to each GDPR setting individually, so you'll likely need to use a separate checkbox field for each.
