# Infusionsoft CRM Integration<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

This documentation page assumes you have read over the [CRM Integration Overview page](./index.mdx#crm). If you have not yet read it, please do so now. We also assume that you have an [Infusionsoft](https://keap.com/infusionsoft) account already. If you currently have Freeform Lite, you can purchase an upgrade to Freeform Pro.

## Compatibility

- Field mapping to standard and custom fields in _Contacts_.

## Duplicate Check & Update

- Duplicate detection is based on the email address.

## Setup Instructions

The Infusionsoft API integration is a little uglier since they include another layer of API calls by using _Mashery_ API Management. Don't trust your instincts and just follow the steps below closely and it won't be as bad as it looks. Please follow the steps below:

### Sign up for a Mashery API Management account

- Infusionsoft runs it's API through Mashery, so you will need to sign up or log into a Mashery account inside the Infusionsoft Developers site.
- [Visit the Infusionsoft Developers site site to sign up for or log into a Mashery account](https://keys.developer.infusionsoft.com/apps/myapps)
- Fill out the form and then click **Register** button.
- You'll receive a confirmation email with a link to click to verify your account.

### Create Mashery API Application

- After verifying your account, click the [create a new application](https://keys.developer.infusionsoft.com/apps/register) button to begin creating your API app.
- Fill out the form, and paste the **OAuth 2.0 Return URI** value from Freeform into the **Register Callback URL** field in Mashery.
- Then click the **Register Application** button.
- You'll be returned to a page that shows you your `client_id` and `client_secret`. Please take note of these and/or leave the browser tab open.

</StepMarkdown>

<StepMarkdown>

### Prepare the Connection

- Go back to your your Craft/Freeform browser tab.
- Copy the `client_id` value from Infusionsoft and paste it into the the **Client ID** field in Freeform.
- Copy the `client_secret` value from Infusionsoft and paste it into the the **Client Secret** field in Freeform.
- At the top right corner of Freeform page, click **Save** button.

</StepMarkdown>

### Finish the Connection

- You will then be presented an Infusionsoft OAuth login form.

- Once logged in, you'll be presented an OAuth form, asking if you want to allow access. Click **Allow** button.
- You should now be returned to the Freeform CRM setting page.
- Confirm that there is a green circle with **Authorized** in the middle of the page.

:::info
There are some odd things with Infusionsoft to note (hopefully this save you some time and frustration when setting up):

- For mapping to Provinces or States, you'll map to the **Region** field. The **Region** field expects values like `US-CA` for California state in USA, or `CA-MB` for Manitoba province in Canada. When mapping to Regions, it's required you map the Country code as well.
- Country code mapping uses 3-digit codes like `USA` for United States of America, `CAN` for Canada, `GBR` for United Kingdom, etc.
