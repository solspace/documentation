# Campaign plugin Integration <Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

This documentation page assumes you have read over the [Email Marketing Integration Overview](./index.mdx#email-marketing). If you have not yet read it, please do so now. We also assume that you have the [Campaign plugin](https://putyourlightson.com/plugins/campaign) installed and setup already. This integration requires that you have _Freeform Pro_. If you currently have Freeform Lite, you can purchase an upgrade to Freeform Pro.

## Compatibility

- Field mapping to regular text field types.
- Mapping to mailing lists from different Sites.

## Setup Instructions

Freeform will detect if Campaign is installed and then show it as an option to use. Because it's a Craft plugin, setup is much simpler:

### Setup Integration on your site

- Go to the [Email Marketing section in Freeform Settings](../configuration/settings.mdx#email-marketing) (**Freeform → Settings → Email Marketing**).
- Click the **New Email Marketing Integration** at the top right.
- Select _Craft Campaign_ from the **Service Provider** select dropdown.
- Enter a name and handle for the integration.
- At the top right corner of Freeform page, click **Save** button.
