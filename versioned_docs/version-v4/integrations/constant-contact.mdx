# Constant Contact Integration<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

This documentation page assumes you have read over the [Email Marketing Integration Overview](./index.mdx#email-marketing). If you have not yet read it, please do so now. We assume that you have a [Constant Contact ](http://constantcontact.com) account already, along with mailing list(s) already created. This integration requires that you have _Freeform Pro_. If you currently have Freeform Lite, you can purchase an upgrade to Freeform Pro.

## Compatibility

The Constant Contact integration includes support for mapping to most standard fields and custom fields.

## Duplicate Check & Update

If a duplicate email address is found in Constant Contact, the profile data will be updated with the latest information submitted.

## 2022 Update Instructions

In early 2022, [Constant Contact announced changes to their API service](https://v3.developer.constantcontact.com/api_guide/auth_update_apps.html). This is a change that breaks existing integrations, and requires an update to Freeform in order to fix the connection. On March 4, 2022, we released Freeform 3.13.4 to address this. For any existing users of this integration (set up before 3.13.4), please follow the below instructions to upgrade your connection:

1. Update to Freeform 3.13.4 or greater.
2. Go to the [Email Marketing section in Freeform Settings](../configuration/settings.mdx#email-marketing) (**Freeform > Settings > Email Marketing**) and click on the existing _Constant Contact_ integration you have configured.
3. Open up a new browser tab and go to Constant Contact's API [_My Applications_ website](https://app.constantcontact.com/pages/dma/portal/).
   - Log into your Constant Contact account there.
   - Go to the **My Applications** page (click at top nav menu).
   - In the list of your application(s), it likely will appear under an **Outdated Applications** list.
   - Click on the **Copy** button for that application, and a copy of the integration application will be created.
   - Open up that application and ensure that Constant Contact's **Redirect URI** field contains the valid URL from Freeform's **Redirect URI** field.
     - If not, you can copy and paste that in here now and click the **Save** button at the top right.
4. Go back to your your Craft/Freeform browser tab.
5. Inside that settings page, click on the **Click here to re-authorize** link.
6. You will then be presented a Constant Contact OAuth confirmation page. Click on the **Allow Access** button.
7. You should then be returned to the Freeform Email Marketing setting page.
8. Confirm that there is a green circle with **Authorized** in the middle of the page.
9. We recommend you test out your form to ensure things are still working smoothly.
