# ClickDimensions POST Forwarding<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

Freeform's [POST Forwarding](../integrations/post-forwarding.mdx) feature allows you to integrate your forms with [ClickDimensions](https://clickdimensions.com/) for Microsoft Dynamics.

This guide assumes you are familiar with [ClickDimensions](https://clickdimensions.com/). We cannot provide any assistance with setting this up, aside from the basics.

## Setup Instructions

<VerticalStepWrapper>

<StepMarkdown>


- Go into your form inside the Freeform form builder interface, and under the **Form Settings** tab, scroll to the very bottom.
- In the **POST Forwarding** setting, add your custom action URL there. Freeform will make an extra POST submit to that URL once it has successfully validated the form submission, etc.
- In the **POST Forwarding Error Trigger** setting, enter a value like `error` (assuming the error page contains that word, and success wouldn't). When Freeform detects that word (or phrase) in the success/error page from the custom ClickDimensions POST URL, it'll assume it's an error and then log the error(s) to the Freeform error log.

</StepMarkdown>

<StepMarkdown>


Add the _ClickDimensions_ script, and then add this AFTER it:

```javascript
var match = document.cookie.match(new RegExp('(^| )cuvid=([^;]+)'));
if (match) {
  var cuvid = match[2];
  document.querySelector('input[name=cd_visitorkey]').value = cuvid;
}
```

Include any additional fields as hidden fields inside Freeform, such as:

- A field with handle `cd_visitorkey` and the key as the value.
- A field with handle `form_friendly_id` and an applicable value, e.g. `ContactUs`.

Be sure to name/rename all Freeform field handles to match the ClickDimensions field names, e.g. `txtFirstName`, etc.
