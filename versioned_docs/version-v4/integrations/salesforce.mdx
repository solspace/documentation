This documentation page assumes you have read over the [CRM Integration Overview](./index.mdx#crm). If you have not yet read it, please do so now. We also assume that you have a [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com) account already. This integration requires that you have _Freeform Pro_. If you currently have Freeform Lite, you can purchase an upgrade to Freeform Pro.

#### Prepare Salesforce's end for Integration

:::warning
This integration will not work with the _Salesforce **Essentials**_ plan as it does not have access to the API.
:::

- Open another browser tab and go to [Salesforce website](https://login.salesforce.com) and log into your account.
- On the left navigation menu, click on **Apps**, then click **App Manager**.
- At the top right corner of the page, click the **New Connected App** button.
- Fill out the fields in the **Basic Information** section.
- In the **API (Enable OAuth Settings)** section, click the **Enable OAuth Settings** checkbox.
- More fields will appear. In the **Callback URL** field, enter any valid URL that begins with **https** (it could even be **https://google.com**, as we don't use this part).
- In the **Selected OAuth Scopes** field, select the following permissions from the list and click **Add** arrow button:
  - **Allow access to your unique identifier (openid)**
  - **Perform requests on your behalf at any time (refresh_token, offline_access)**
- You shouldn't need to fill out any further fields, and then click **Save** button.
- You will be taken to a new page that lists info about your newly created app, including **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret** values. You will need to copy each of these values.
  - Salesforce gets tricky to navigate, so do yourself a favor and copy and paste these 2 values into a text editor for now, being sure to label each too. You'll save yourself some extra steps later on.
- At the top middle of the page, click on the **Manage** button.
- At the top middle of the next page, click the **Edit Policies** button.
- Under the **OAuth policies** section, adjust the following settings:
  - In the **Permitted Users** field, be sure that it is set to **All users may self-authorize**.
  - In the **IP Relaxation** field, change the setting to **Relaxed IP restrictions**.
  - Click **Save** button at bottom of page.
- If you copy and pasted the **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret** values in a text editor, you can skip these next couple steps:
  - To go back to your app to see these values, click on the **App Manager** navigation item (under **Apps**)
  - Find your app in the list. Then in the right column, click the down arrow, and then click **View**.

</StepMarkdown>

</VerticalStepWrapper>

### Alternate Config File Setup

The Salesforce Lead integration allows you the choice of entering your API keys and credentials via a config file instead if you wish. For more information about Freeform's config overrides, please see [Project Config](../configuration/project-config.mdx) documentation. A brief overview is below:

- Copy and paste the following code into a new file named `freeform.php` and place it into your Craft `/config/` directory:

  ```php showLineNumbers
  <?php

  return [
      "salesforce_client_id"     => null,
      "salesforce_client_secret" => null,
      "salesforce_username"      => null,
      "salesforce_password"      => null,
  ];
  ```

- Replace the `null` value for **salesforce_client_id** with the Salesforce **Consumer Key** value.
- Replace the `null` value for **salesforce_client_secret** with the Salesforce **Consumer Secret** value.
- Replace the `null` value for **salesforce_username** with your Salesforce account username/email address.
- Replace the `null` value for **salesforce_password** with your Salesforce account password.
- Save the changes in the **freeform.php** file.
- Your final file should look something like this:

  ```php showLineNumbers
  <?php

  return [
      "salesforce_client_id"     => "7SDf7GFDG6O76sd798FdG98s9897F9G7dSFDF9G7sd980G8dfG9FG_aSD650g8dsh7D98g79Fs98ds0788Ps",
      "salesforce_client_secret" => "1234567890123456789",
      "salesforce_username"      => "you@youremail.com",
      "salesforce_password"      => "yourSalesforcePassword",
  ];
  ```

## Salesforce Opportunity CRM Integration

:::info
[Click here if you're looking for the Salesforce _Lead_ integration.](#salesforce-lead-crm-integration)
:::

### Compatibility

The Salesforce _Opportunity_ integration includes support for field mapping to standard and custom _Opportunity_, _Account_ and _Contact_ object fields. There are some limitations to types of fields that can be mapped, such as **Lookup** fields.

### Duplicate Check & Update

#### Default Logic

A duplicate check on records is done in the following way:

1. Check whether the _Account_ already exists:
   - Check against the **Name** field as the identifier.
     - Freeform will create an _Account_ with the **First Name** and **Last Name** mapped to the _Contact_ if you leave the _Account_ **Name** field empty. This is helpful if you are dealing with customers not necessarily belonging to a company or organization, and just wish to have a Salesforce Account matching the Contact.
   - If no match, create a new _Account_.
2. Check whether the _Contact_ already exists:
   - Check against the **Email address** as the identifier.
   - If email address exists in Salesforce _Contact_, update the existing Contact with other details.
   - If no email address match, check if **first name** and **last name** exist in Salesforce _Contact_, then update the existing _Contact_ with all other values including the new email address.
   - If no matches at all, create a new Salesforce _Contact_.
   - If _Account_ **Name** matched, assign the new Contact to the existing Salesforce Account.
3. Create new _Opportunity_.
   - Attach _Opportunity_ to existing or newly created Salesforce _Account_.

#### Alternate Logic

An alternate duplicate check on records is also available. When the **Check Contact email address and Account website when checking for duplicates?** setting is enabled, the following logic will happen instead:

1. Check whether the _Contact_ already exists:
   - Check against **Email address** as the identifier.
   - If there's a match, update the _Contact_ with new values, where supplied.
   - If no match, create a new _Contact_.
2. Check whether the _Account_ already exists:
   - Check against the **Website** field domain. If you are not mapping a domain to the **Website** field, Freeform will automatically sniff the _Contact_ email address, take the domain from it and pass it off to the Salesforce _Account_ as the **Website** field value.
   - If there's a match, update the _Account_ with new values, where supplied.
   - If no match, create a new Salesforce _Account_.
   - If a new _Contact_ was created, link the contact to the _Account_.
3. Create new _Opportunity_.
   - Attach _Opportunity_ to existing or newly created Salesforce _Account_.

#### Set up Integration on your site

- Go to the [CRM section in Freeform Settings](../configuration/settings.mdx#crm) (**Freeform > Settings > CRM**).
- Click the **New CRM Integration** at the top right.
- Select _Salesforce Opportunity_ from the **Service Provider** select dropdown.
- Enter a name and handle for the integration.

  - **Close Date**
    - Enter a relative textual date string for the Close Date of the newly created Opportunity (e.g. `7 days`).
  - **Stage Name**
    - Enter the Stage Name the newly created Opportunity should be assigned to (e.g. `Prospecting`).
  - **Sandbox Mode**
    - Enable this if your Salesforce account is in Sandbox mode.
  - **Append checkbox group field values on Contact update?**
    - If a Contact already exists in Salesforce, enabling this will append additional checkbox group field values to the Contact inside Salesforce, instead of overwriting the options.
  - **Append checkbox group field values on Account update?**
    - If an Account already exists in Salesforce, enabling this will append additional checkbox group field values to the Account inside Salesforce, instead of overwriting the options.
  - **Check Contact email address and Account website when checking for duplicates?**
    - By default, Freeform will check against Contact first name, last name and email address, as well as and Account name. If enabled, Freeform will instead check against Contact email address only and Account website. If no website is mapped, Freeform will gather the website domain from the Contact email address mapped.
