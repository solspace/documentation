# Element Field Types

Calendar includes Calendar Events and Calendar Calendars fieldtypes, which allows you to assign/relate events and whole calendars (ID's) to other element types such as Craft Entries and even other events themselves.

## Calendar Events

The Calendar Events field type allows you to assign/relate events to other element types such as Craft Entries and even other Calendar events.

### Creating an Events field

Creating a Calendar Events field is done just like any other fieldtype, here's an overview of the process:

1. Go to the **Settings** area in Craft control panel. Click on **Fields**.
2. Click the **New field** button in the top right corner.
3. Name the field as you wish. For example: _Related Events_ with a handle of _relatedEvents_.
4. For the **Field Type** option, select _Calendar Events_ from the list.
5. The **Sources** list lets you narrow down the possible assignable events to this field by calendar. Select all or whichever calendar(s) you'd like.
6. **Limit** limits the number of events you can select for this field.
7. **Selection Label** is the text that will appear on the button which opens the Event selection pop-up dialog.
8. Click the **Save** button in the top right corner to save the new field.

Your Calendar Events field is now available to be assigned to other sections.

### How the Fieldtype works

The Calendar Event fieldtype lets the user assign any events that have been created in the Calendar Events page to any element: a section entry, categories, assets, etc. Even events themselves.

## Use in Templates

You add the _Solspace Calendar_ Event fieldtype to your template code just like you would for any other field. Continuing off the example above (with handle of _relatedEvents_), your code would look something like this:

```twig showLineNumbers
{% if entry.relatedEvents is defined and entry.relatedEvents is not empty %}
  <ul>
  {% for event in entry.relatedEvents.status(null) %}
    <li>
      {{ event.title }} - {{ event.startDateUtc.format("l, F j, Y \\a\\t g:ia") }}
      ({{ event.simpleEventObject.duration.humanReadable }})
      in {{ event.calendar.name }} calendar.
      {% if event.simpleEventObject.repeating %}
        Repeats {{ event.simpleEventObject.readableRepeatRule }}
      {% endif %}
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
  </ul>
{% else %}
  <p>No events related to this entry.</p>
{% endif %}
```

For some advanced data from the [Event object](../templates/objects/event.mdx), you'll need to call the `simpleEventObject` getter. So for example:

- `duration.humanReadable` becomes `simpleEventObject.duration.humanReadable`
- `repeating` becomes `simpleEventObject.repeating`
- `readableRepeatRule` becomes `simpleEventObject.readableRepeatRule`

Dates also need to specify UTC to display correctly:

- `startDate` becomes `startDateUtc`
- `endDate` becomes `endDateUtc`
