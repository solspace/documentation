# Importing Events

Calendar currently has no built in importing options available. However, through the [Verbb Feed Me plugin](https://github.com/verbb/feed-me/tree/craft-2), you can import and/or update existing Calendar events using the [Calendar helper plugin](https://github.com/verbb/feed-me-helpers). Importing tools are very complex to get right, and rather than reinventing the wheel we've decided to recommend the _Feed Me_ plugin.

Currently, there are 5 different feed types available to choose from:

- **ATOM**
- **CSV**
- **JSON**
- **RSS**
- **XML**

You can select which calendar to check against, and decide from any of the following behaviors:

- **Create new events**: Adds new events if they do not already exist.
- **Update existing events**: Updates events that match the Unique Identifier (next step).
- **Disable missing events**: Disables any events that are missing from the feed.
- **Delete missing events**: Deletes any events that are missing from the feed. Be careful.
