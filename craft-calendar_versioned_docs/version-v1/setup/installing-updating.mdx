## Updating Instructions

_Solspace Calendar_ uses the **Craft Update Service**, which means that every time there's an update available, it'll show up in the **Updates** area of the Craft control panel. You can then review the changelog there, or [view it here](./changelog.mdx).

To download the update, simply click the download button (you'll be taken to your account area on the Solspace site) and download the updated package for _Solspace Calendar_. Then follow the steps below:

1. Within your Craft sites **/craft/plugins/** directory, delete the _calendar_ folder.
2. Unzip the download package and copy the new _calendar_ folder to your Craft sites **/craft/plugins/** directory.
3. Visit the Craft control panel and let the upgrade routine run.

## Quick Setup

Follow the steps below to quickly get Solspace Calendar setup in minutes.

1. Customize and configure Solspace Calendar settings by visiting the [Settings](../configuration/settings.mdx) page (**Freeform > Settings**).
2. Calendar ties into regular Craft User Group Permissions. Simply visit the Craft permissions page for the applicable user group(s) (**Settings > Users > User Groups**) to grant/edit/remove permissions to Calendar. See [Permissions](../configuration/permissions.mdx) documentation for more information.
3. Install the [Demo Templates](../configuration/demo-templates.mdx) (**Calendar > Settings > Demo Templates**) to get Calendar up and running on the front end with just a couple clicks!

## Common Issues

Currently, there are only 2 known issues:

- **ISSUE**: After installation, when going to _Calendar_ page I am getting the following error: "**Method "settings" for object "Craft\CalendarVariable" does not exist**"
  - **CAUSE**: If you have the Tipping Media _Venti_ plugin currently installed, you might run into this issue due to a namespace collision. _Calendar_ uses the **Calendar** namespace, but _Venti_ seems to sometimes use it as well.
  - **SOLUTION**: If your site is not live, or you're not dependent on this plugin, simply disable it (**Settings > Plugins** then click **Disable** button) or if you're not using it, uninstall it.
- **ISSUE**: When attempting to use Calendar on front end templates, I am getting the following error: "**Call to undefined method CalendarLibraryCarbon::setWeekStartsAt()**"
  - **CAUSE**: The issue has to do with another third party plugin installed that also uses [Carbon](http://carbon.nesbot.com/). A commonly reported plgin is [Postmaster](https://github.com/objectivehtml/Postmaster-for-Craft-CMS), which appears to be using an older copy of Carbon. _Calendar_ ends up loading Postmaster's Carbon library, causing this issue.
  - **SOLUTION**: Manually updating the **vendors** directory for the affected plugin to use latest versions may resolve this issue. Customers affected with this issue specifically for _Postmaster_ plugin can contact [Solspace support](/support/) for an updated _vendors_ folder for Postmaster that may resolve the issue.
