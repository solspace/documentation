# Week object

A _Week_ object holds in itself a list of all [Events](./event.mdx) that fall into this week, as well as gives the possibility to iterate over [Day object](./day.mdx)'s that fall into the range of this **Week object**.

## Properties

- `date`
  - A [Date object](./date.mdx) of the starting date of the event duration
  - For a _Week_ object of **April 15, 2023** and week starting day of **Sunday**, this would return the [Date object](./date.mdx) of `2023-04-10` with the starting day of the week set to **Sunday**
- `startDate`
  - Basically the same as the `date` property
- `endDate`
  - The ending date of the _Week_ object's week, e.g - `2023-04-16` in this case
- `previousDate`
  - Returns a [Date object](./date.mdx) of the previous week relative to the `date` property, e.g. `2023-04-03` in this case
- `nextDate`
  - Returns a [Date object](./date.mdx) of the next week relative to the `date` property, e.g. `2023-05-17` in this case
- `events`
  - Contains a list of [Events](./event.mdx) that fall into this _Week_ object's range
- `eventCount`
  - The number of events in the `events` property

## Methods

- `dateRange(int before, int after)`
  - Returns a list of [Date objects](./date.mdx) ranging `before` number of weeks before `date` and `after` number of weeks after `date`
  - E.g. `week.dateRange(6, 6)` would return a list starting from `2023-02-28` and ending in `2023-05-22`
- `containsDate(dateObject)`
  - Returns **true** if the `dateObject` provided is within the _Week_ object's date range
  - E.g. `week.containsDate(event.startDate)` would return **true** if the _Week_ object would be **April 15, 2023** starting on Sunday, and the `event.startDate` would be `2023-04-10`, but **false** if the `event.startDate` would be `2023-04-09`

## Usage in Templates

Iterate through days of the week

```twig showLineNumbers
{% set week = craft.calendar.week({
  date: "today",
  calendar: ["holidays", "sports"]
}) %}

{% for day in week %}
  {% for event in day.events %}
    <div style="{{ event.calendar.color }};">
      {{ event.title }}
    </div>
  {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
```

---

Iterate through all events in the week

```twig showLineNumbers
{% set week = craft.calendar.week({
  date: "today",
  calendar: ["holidays", "sports"]
}) %}

{% for event in week.events %}
  <div style="{{ event.calendar.color }};">
    {{ event.title }}
  </div>
{% endfor %}
```

---

Show only events which start in weekdays

```twig showLineNumbers
{% set week = craft.calendar.week({
  date: "today",
  calendar: ["holidays", "sports"]
}) %}

{% for event in week.events if event.startDate.weekday %}
  <div style="{{ event.calendar.color }};">
    {{ event.title }}
  </div>
{% endfor %}
```
