# Event Query

The _calendar.event_ template function fetches a single event by its unique ID or slug.

## Parameters

First parameter is the ID or slug of the event, the second parameter is an object of optional parameters listed below

- `occurrenceDate` <a href="#param-occurrence-date" id="param-occurrence-date" className="docs-anchor">#</a>
  - Specify an occurrence date if you wish to show a recurring event for a specific date
- `occurrenceRangeStart` <a href="#param-occurrence-range-start" id="param-occurrence-range-start" className="docs-anchor">#</a>
  - A date string to specify the time range for which to start fetching occurrences for a recurring event
  - You can use a `Y-m-d` string
  - A relative string like `6 months ago`
- `occurrenceRangeEnd` <a href="#param-occurrence-range-end" id="param-occurrence-range-end" className="docs-anchor">#</a>
  - A date string to specify the end date
- `occurrenceLimit` <a href="#param-occurrence-limit" id="param-occurrence-limit" className="docs-anchor">#</a>
  - Specify an `int` for hard limiting the amount of occurrences fetched. This defaults to **200**, since never-ending recurrences must have a limit
- `status` <a href="#param-status" id="param-status" className="docs-anchor">#</a>
  - Specify `null` to include disabled events. Defaults to showing enabled events only.

## Usage in Templates

```twig showLineNumbers
{% set event = craft.calendar.event(15, {
  occurrenceLimit: 15,
  occurrenceRangeStart: "today",
  occurrenceRangeEnd: "6 months"
}) %}

{% if event %}
  {{ event.title }}<br>
  {{ event.startDate.format("l d, Y") }}
{% endif %}
```

You can also access any custom fields which you have added to events by directly calling their **handle** (the **handle** must not match any of the existing event properties). If you had a field called _Event Description_ with a handle of **eventDescription** you would access it in the template like this:

```twig showLineNumbers
{{ event.eventDescription }}
```

You could make sure such a property exists first, to prevent errors in case the field is deleted:

```twig showLineNumbers
{% if event.eventDescription is defined %}
  {{ event.eventDescription }}
{% endif %}
```

Let's use a Date method to check if our event's start date is before the current Day's date

```twig showLineNumbers
{# Print out the Y-m-d of start date if start date is before the Day date #}

{% if event.startDate.lt(day.date) %}
  {{ event.startDate.dateString }}
{% endif %}
```

Now let's print out the duration of the event, which is the amount of time in months, days, hours, etc from the event's start date until its end date

```twig showLineNumbers
{# Print out the duration string #}
{# An example output would be "1d 5h 30m" #}

{{ event.duration.humanReadable }}

{# Print out a custom message if the duration in days is 1 or more #}

{% if event.duration.days >= 1 %}
  Event spans for {{ event.duration.days }} days
{% endif %}
```
