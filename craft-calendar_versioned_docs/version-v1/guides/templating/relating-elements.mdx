# Relating Elements

This page serves as an example of how to [relate elements](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/relations.html) to _Solspace Calendar_ events.

In this example we have set up two calendars. One is a **Tournaments** (`tournaments`) calendar, which holds all of our upcoming tournaments. The other is an **Events** (`events`) calendar, which holds sub-events happening during the tournaments.

The relationship is unidirectional, going from Tournaments to Events. Meaning, our Tournaments know which Events happen in them, but Events don't know which Tournaments they belong to.

Listing tournaments and their respective sub-events is easy:

```twig showLineNumbers
<h2>Upcoming Tournaments</h2>

{# Getting tournaments only here #}
{% set tournaments = craft.calendar.events({
  calendar: ["tournaments"]
}) %}

{% for tournament in tournaments %}
<ul>
  <li>
    <div>
      <strong>{{ tournament.title }}</strong>:
      {{ tournament.startDate.toDateString }} - {{ tournament.endDate.toDateString }}
    </div>

    {% if tournament.tournamentEvents|length %}

    {#
      We could just iterate over tournament.tournamentEvents but since Calendar_EventModel
      contains unneeded logic which becomes a problem when loading thousands of events, we
      have to fetch thin Event objects using the craft.calendar.events() template function.
    #}

    {% set events = craft.calendar.events({
      id: tournament.tournamentEvents.ids
    }) %}

    <ul>
      {% for event in events %}
      <li>
        <div>
          <strong>{{ event.title }}</strong>:
          {{ event.startDate.toDateTimeString }} ({{ event.duration }})
        </div>
      </li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    {% endif %}
  </li>
</ul>
{% endfor %}
```

Listing sub-events and the tournament they belong to is a little bit more complicated:

```twig showLineNumbers
<h2>Event list</h2>

{# Getting non-tournament events here #}
{% set events = craft.calendar.events({
  calendar: ["events"]
}) %}

{% for event in events %}
<ul>
  <li>
    <div>
      <strong>{{ event.title }}</strong>:
      {{ event.startDate.toDateString }} - {{ event.endDate.toDateString }}
    </div>

    {# We get any related tournaments here. Since two tournaments MIGHT link to the same event #}
    {% set tournaments = craft.calendar.events().relatedTo(event.id) %}
    {% if tournaments|length %}
    <ul>
      {% for tournament in tournaments %}
      <li>
        <div>
          <strong>{{ tournament.title }}</strong>:
          {{ tournament.startDate.toDateString }} ({{ tournament.duration }})
        </div>
      </li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    {% endif %}
  </li>
</ul>
{% endfor %}
```
