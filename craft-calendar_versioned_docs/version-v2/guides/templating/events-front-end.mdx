# Creating/Editing Events on the Front End

_Solspace Calendar_ allows you to create and edit events on the front end as well. Due to the complexity of the Event element UI, it's best to observe its functionality and example code in the [Demo Templates](../../configuration/demo-templates.mdx). Simply install the Demo Templates that come included with Calendar, and click to the **Create** tab.

## Overview

A few important things to note are that:

- All Calendar Event fields are part of the `calendarEvent[]` array.
- Title and slug fields are standalone fields.
- Custom fields are all part of `fields[]` array. So if your field handle is **location**, your input name value would be `fields[location]`
