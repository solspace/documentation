### Custom Plugin Name<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

Override the plugin name by specifying your own here.

### Week Starting Day

The starting day of the week when viewing front end and control panel Month and Week views as well as datepickers. Default is _Current user's Locale_, meaning that Calendar will display the first day of the week depending on the currently logged in user.

- Sunday
- Monday
- Tuesday
- Wednesday
- Thursday
- Friday
- Saturday

### Time Format<Badge type="feature" text="3.3.0+" />

Time format for dates and date pickers throughout the control panel. This allows you to override what all users see instead of it varying between each user's locale.

Options are:

- Current user's locale
- 12-hour format
- 24-hour format

### Display Mini Calendar & Calendars list in Month/Week/Day views?

Displays a side menu with mini calendar and list of calendars, allowing you to filter your event results.

### Include Disabled Events in Month/Week/Day views?

Events that are disabled will be displayed in the views with faded styles.

### Allow new events to be created in Month/Week/Day views?

Allows all users with event creation privileges to use the Quick Create event feature.

### Restrict users to editing their own events only?

Users (excluding Admins) with event creation privileges will only be able to edit or delete their own events.

### Default Event Duration

The default event time duration for fieldtype, in minutes. When event Start Time is selected, this number of minutes will automatically be added to that time for End Time field.

### Time Interval

The time picker interval for fieldtype, in minutes. The Start Time and End Time field time pickers will contain a list of times of the day by this interval.

### Select 'All Day' by default?

When enabled, when creating new events the 'All Day' option will be selected by default.

### Date Overlap Threshold

Specify the amount of hours in the next day which are still considered as those of the previous day. This prevents late night events from showing up the next day for calendars in control panel and front end.

## Guest Access

/>

Allows you to install the [Demo Templates](./demo-templates.mdx) to get Calendar up and running on the front end with just a couple clicks!

## Console Commands<Badge type="feature" text="3.0.4+" />

If you need to resave all Calendar events, you can do so with the following CLI command: `./craft calendar/events/resave`. Most of the arguments available to Craft's `resave/entries` command are available here too, so if you need to also update the Craft Search Index, be sure to add `--update-search-index`.

```sh
php craft calendar/events/resave --update-search-index
```
