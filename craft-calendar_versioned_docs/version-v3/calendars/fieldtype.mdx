# Element Field Type

The Calendar Calendars field type allows you to assign/relate whole calendars (ID's) to other element types such as Craft Entries. What actually is related is the calendar ID, thus allowing you to then pull in events for the given calendar attached to the Craft element.

### Creating a Calendars field

Creating a Calendar Calendars field is done just like any other fieldtype, here's an overview of the process:

1. Go to the **Settings** area in Craft control panel. Click on **Fields**.
2. Click the **New field** button in the top right corner.
3. Name the field as you wish. For example: _Related Calendars_ with a handle of _relatedCalendars_.
4. For the **Field Type** option, select _Calendar Calendars_ from the list.
5. Click the **Save** button in the top right corner to save the new field.

Your Calendar Calendars field is now available to be assigned to other sections.

### How the Fieldtype works

The Calendar Calendars fieldtype lets the user choose 1 calendar to assign to any element: a section entry, categories, assets, etc.
