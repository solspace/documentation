    ```twig showLineNumbers
    {% if event.isHappeningOn('2023-03-07 4:30pm') %} Yes! {% endif %}
    ```

You can also access any custom fields which you have added to events by directly calling their **handle** (the **handle** must not match any of the existing event properties).

## Usage in Templates

You can also access any custom fields which you have added to events by directly calling their **handle** (the **handle** must not match any of the existing event properties). If you had a field called _Event Description_ with a handle of **eventDescription** you would access it in the template like this:

```twig showLineNumbers
{{ event.eventDescription }}
```

You could make sure such a property exists first, to prevent errors in case the field is deleted:

```twig showLineNumbers
{% if event.eventDescription is defined %}
  {{ event.eventDescription }}
{% endif %}
```

Let's use a Date method to check if our event's start date is before the current Day's date

```twig showLineNumbers
{# Print out the Y-m-d of start date if start date is before the Day date #}

{% if event.startDate.lt(day.date) %}
  {{ event.startDate.dateString }}
{% endif %}
```

Now let's print out the duration of the event, which is the amount of time in months, days, hours, etc from the event's start date until its end date

```twig showLineNumbers
{# Print out the duration string #}
{# An example output would be "1d 5h 30m" #}

{{ event.duration.humanReadable }}

{# Print out a custom message if the duration in days is 1 or more #}

{% if event.duration.days >= 1 %}
  Event spans for {{ event.duration.days }} days
{% endif %}
```
