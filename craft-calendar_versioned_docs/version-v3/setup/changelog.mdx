[Please follow the upgrading guide available here](https://docs.solspace.com/craft/calendar/v3/setup/updating-calendar-2/)!
:::

- Added setting to disable (hide) the repeat rule options per calendar when editing/creating events.

- Overhauled the Create/Edit event UI to be more intuitive and also match Craft 3.4 styling.

- Fixed a bug where using the 'Save and continue editing' option while creating a new event would advance to a different Site instead of staying on the current one.
