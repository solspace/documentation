# Updating from Calendar 2.x

The Calendar 2.x to Calendar 3.x upgrade is special for a variety of reasons, but the transition should be fairly smooth:

- It introduces several new features.
- It introduces a new _Lite_ edition at a lower price for sites with simpler needs.
- Previous _Standard_ license customers have had their licenses automatically switched to _Pro_ licenses (the exact equivelant to _Standard_ in Calendar 2.x).

## Key Changes

Calendar 3 brings some exciting new features to Calendar!

:::info
**All Calendar customers' v2 _Standard_ licenses have been upgraded/renamed to v3 _Pro_ licenses as of February 4, 2020.** If your Calendar license(s) have expired, and you wish to renew to get access to Calendar 3, please be aware that the new equivelant license is _Pro_.
:::

- Added Lite edition for Calendar for simpler setups. The key differences are:
  - No ICS export/subscriptions
  - No repeating rules
  - No dashboard widgets
  - No renaming of plugin name
- Added ability to group a list of upcoming events by day, week or month, and display a heading for each.
- Added ability to show a list of upcoming events, but only display one (or a specified amount) of the next upcoming recurrences for repeating events, instead of all available ones.
- Added setting to disable (hide) the repeat rule options per calendar when editing/creating events.
- Added a 'Calendars' fieldtype, which allows for relating an entire calendar (ID) to other Craft elements.
- Overhauled the Create/Edit event UI to be more intuitive and also match Craft 3.4 styling.

## Updating from 2.x

#### To transition from Calendar 2.x to Calendar 3.x, please follow the instructions below very carefully.

1. <span class="red">BACKUP YOUR SITE FILES AND DATABASE.</span>
2. Be sure to first carefully upgrade to Craft 3.4+ if you haven't already.
3. Carefully review the [changelog](./changelog.mdx) for Calendar 3.x.
4. If your Calendar license is currently expired, you will need to renew your license. Please note that your previous _Standard_ edition license is now called _Pro_ edition.
5. We recommend updating via Composer from the Terminal:
   - Open your Craft site's main `composer.json` file and adjust the following information (example) FROM:
     ```json {6} showLineNumbers
     "require": {
         "php": ">=7.0.0",
         "craftcms/cms": "^3.1.0",
         "vlucas/phpdotenv": "v2.4.0",
         "solspace/craft-freeform": "^3.6.0",
         "solspace/craft3-calendar": "^2.0.0"
     },
     ```
   - Change it TO:
     ```json {6} showLineNumbers
     "require": {
         "php": ">=7.0.0",
         "craftcms/cms": "^3.4.0",
         "vlucas/phpdotenv": "v2.4.0",
         "solspace/craft-freeform": "^3.6.0",
         "solspace/craft-calendar": "^3.0.0"
     },
     ```
   - Open your Terminal and go to your Craft project: `cd /path/to/project`
   - To run the available updates for your site, run `composer update`
6. Proceed to Craft control panel and click the **Finish Updates** button when it shows.
7. Go to the Plugins section of your Craft 3 control panel (**Craft CP** -> **Settings** -> **Plugins**) and ensure that you have the _Pro_ edition of Calendar. If not, follow the steps below:
   - Click on the **Lite \ Trial** flag/button, which will take you to the Calendar product page inside the Craft Plugin Store.

       alt="Switch editions, Step 1"
     />
   - Click on the **Reactivate** button to activate the _Pro_ edition for your site.

       alt="Switch editions, Step 2"
     />
   - Alternatively, you could edit the `edition` setting for Calendar inside Craft's [Project Config](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/project-config.html) file to have a value of `pro`.
8. Carefully review Calendar inside the control panel and in your templates and ensure that everything works correctly and/or necessary updates to templates/settings are made. If you ever use the demo templates to review/test/experiment, please note that there have been updates made to them, so you may wish to reinstall them.
9. If you are [creating/editing events on the front end](../guides/templating/events-front-end.mdx), please be sure to update the hidden **action** field value to `calendar/legacy-events/save-event`. See the example in the demo templates or [in documentation](../guides/templating/events-front-end.mdx#example-code-from-demo-templates) for complete working code.

## Troubleshooting

If something didn't go right, or if you're viewing this guide _after_ performing the upgrade from Calendar 2.x to 3.x, please check out some of the common issues below:

- [Seeing plugin licensing errors](#seeing-plugin-licensing-errors)

### Seeing plugin licensing errors

If you're seeing licensing errors in the control panel such as:

> Thereâ€™s a licensing issue with the Calendar plugin. Please fix on an environment where administrative changes are allowed.

This might be because you're using the wrong edition or specifying the wrong edition in your Project Config file, etc.

#### To resolve this issue:

If using Craft's [Project Config](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/project-config.html) feaure, open up your `project.yaml` file and check for `calendar`. Ensure that the edition property contains a value of `lite` or `pro` (according to which edition you have), and NOT `standard`.

If that still does not resolve the issue, please see the [Changing Editions](./installing-updating.mdx#changing-editions) documentation.
