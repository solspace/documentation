## Calendar Agenda widget<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

The Calendar Agenda widget is really a **3-in-1** widget that allows you to select simplified mini versions of the **Month**, **Week** and **Day** views you see in the _Solspace Calendar_ control panel area. Select the type you most prefer, or make one of each! Use the settings to set which calendars you'd like to include, and what you'd like for the title of the widget. For **Week** and **Day** widgets, it will automatically scroll to the current time for the logged in user.

With the Upcoming Events widget, you'll be able to see an overview of upcoming events from your calendar. Use the settings to set which calendars you'd like to include, the title for the widget, and how many events it should display.

## Mini Calendar widget<Badge type="pro" text="Pro" />

With the Mini Calendar widget, you'll be able to browse through months with AJAX and see which days in the current month have events in them, as well as go directly to any date in the Day view when you click on a day number.
