# Importing Events

Calendar now has an official integration for the Craft [Feed Me](https://docs.craftcms.com/feed-me/v4/) plugin, which allows you to import and/or update existing Calendar events. When using **Feed Me**, please be sure to look for the _Solspace Calendar Events (official)_ option for the **Element Type** type option when setting up a new feed. To get the Craft [Feed Me](https://plugins.craftcms.com/feed-me) plugin, search for `feed me` in the Craft Plugin Store.

## Overview

Currently, there are 5 different feed types available to choose from:

- **ATOM**
- **CSV**
- **JSON**
- **RSS**
- **XML**

You can select which calendar to check against, and decide from any of the following behaviors:

- **Create new events**: Adds new events if they do not already exist.
- **Update existing events**: Updates events that match the Unique Identifier (next step).
- **Disable missing events**: Disables any events that are missing from the feed.
- **Delete missing events**: Deletes any events that are missing from the feed. Be careful.

The most important fields to import on the **Event Fields** mapping page are:

- **Title**
- **Start Date** (e.g. `2021-02-14 07:00:00`)
- **End Date** (e.g. `2021-02-14 13:00:00`)
- **All Day** (e.g. `1` for all-day, `0` for non all-day events)
- **Repeat Rule** (e.g. `RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;UNTIL=20211016T235959Z;BYMONTHDAY=14;INTERVAL=1`)
  - This is only necessary when you have repeating events.
  - If you have a valid _RRULE_ mapped to the **Repeat Rule** setting, Calendar will automatically map the necessary parts over to the other fields/columns in the database. By default, if `INTERVAL` is not included in the _RRULE_ value, Calendar will assume and default it to `1`.
  - The other remaining **Recurrence Fields** options are all optional and likely not necessary for most setups if you have a valid _RRULE_ value.
  - If you have repeating events but do not have a valid _RRULE_ value to map, you can map the other **Recurrence Fields** options individually. However, without a value _RRULE_ passed off to the Calendar event's **RRULE** column in the database, Calendar will not be able to properly display recurrences until the event is resaved manually.
