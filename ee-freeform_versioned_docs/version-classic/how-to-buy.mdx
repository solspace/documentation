## New Purchases of Freeform Classic

Freeform Classic is no longer actively developed (aside from security vulnerability fixes), and no longer available for purchase as of July 5, 2021. If it all possible, please strongly consider the [new Freeform](../../ee-freeform/intro.mdx) (_Next_). If you absolutely need to use Freeform Classic, you can purchase a copy of the [new Freeform](../../ee-freeform/intro.mdx) (Pro) and then [contact Solspace Support](/support) and we'll manually send you a copy of it. Freeform Classic currently works with ExpressionEngine 2.11 - ExpressionEngine 5.x.

To purchase and receive Freeform Classic, follow the steps below:

1. Visit the [EE Add-ons Store](https://expressionengine.com/add-ons/freeform).
2. Purchase a license to **Freeform Pro**.
3. [Contact Solspace Support](/support) with your email address used to purchase the license.
4. We'll send you a copy of Freeform Classic.

## Upgrading from EE 2.x

:::info
If you'd like to switch to the [new Freeform](#switch-to-the-new-freeform) (_Next_), check out the [guide below](#switch-to-the-new-freeform).
:::

If you'd like to upgrade from the old Freeform _Free 4.x_ or _Pro 4.x_ (aka Freeform _Classic_) for ExpressionEngine 2.x, we've continued to make Freeform Classic available and working for EE3, EE4 and EE5. It's no longer maintained, and there's no guarantees it will work with ExpressionEngine 6.x (whenever that is available and what it entails). However, some customers prefer to do a simple upgrade of Freeform without having to switch and learn the new Freeform, so we have continued to offer discounted upgrades (for old _Pro_ license holders) to the latest versions of Freeform Customers.

The features between the latest Classic 4.x for EE2 and Classic 5.x and 6.x are all the same, and upgrades should be straight forward, as they shouldn't require any changes to your site setup and templates, etc.

- [Upgrading from Freeform Pro 4.x](#upgrading-from-freeform-pro-4-x)

#### Upgrading from Freeform Free 4.x

There is no longer a free edition of Freeform Classic. Any customers with Freeform Free 4.x that wish to continue to use Freeform Classic must purchase a new full license for it. You can follow the steps listed above for [New Purchases of Freeform Classic](#new-purchases-of-freeform-classic), but follow _Upgrading_ procedure instead of _Installation_.

#### Upgrading from Freeform Pro 4.x

For existing Freeform Pro 4.x customers that require continuing to use Freeform Classic, you can [purchase a new copy of Freeform Classic](#new-purchases-of-freeform-classic) following the instructions above (no longer eligible for an upgrade discount). Once completed, download a copy of that and follow the [upgrading procedures](./setup/installing-updating.mdx) in the documentation.

If you run into any issues, please [contact Solspace Support](/support) for assistance.
