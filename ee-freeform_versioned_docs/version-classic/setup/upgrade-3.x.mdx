# Upgrading from Freeform 3.x to Freeform Classic 4+

:::warning
There is no migration utility in Freeform Classic 4.x+ to upgrade from Freeform 3.x. If using EE2, Freeform 3.x users should upgrade to Freeform 4.x on EE2 first, then to EE3 and Freeform 5.x+. Freeform Classic 4.x/5.x/6.x all virtually have the same feature set.
:::

Some of the key changes for Freeform Classic 4.x+ is that forms are now pre-set in the control panel, and are no longer "loose" like they used to be in Freeform 3.x. This means that you must take the time to set up your forms in the control panel, and correctly assign custom fields and notifications templates. This also means that you will see large performance benefits as each form has its own table in the database (whereas all forms shared one in Freeform 3.x), as well as robust managing and administrating of forms and their submissions.

Freeform Classic 4.x+ also introduces the concept of field types, just like you have for channel fields. It allows you to smartly create and manage a wide variety of field types, giving you more flexibility in the data you collect, and more control in how it displays in the front end templates, notification templates, and control panel. One key difference between Freeform 3.x and 4.x+ is how files/attachments are handled. Freeform Classic now contains a File Upload field type, allowing you enormous flexibility in how you handle, store and display file attachments.

Lastly, new to Freeform Classic 4.x+ is a built in Composer tool, which is an intuitive and enjoyable drag and drop interface to create your forms. In Freeform Classic 4.x+, you can create and manage your forms in either the new Composer tool, or the traditional approach within EE templates (like Freeform 3.x does). Freeform Classic 4.x+ allows you to have some forms that are Composer-built, and some that are EE template-based - it's your choice!
