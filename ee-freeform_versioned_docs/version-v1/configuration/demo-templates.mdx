## Installing the Demo Templates

To install the Demo Templates, simply visit the **Demo Templates** nav item in Freeform (**Freeform > Settings > Demo Templates**).

By default, the Demo Templates page will be set to **freeform_next_demo** for template group name. You can change this to whatever you like.

During installation of demo templates, Freeform will copy the templates over to the Template Manager for EE. The default CSS and JS assets for demo templates are located in the **./themes/user/freeform_next/lib/codepack/** directory.

Using the above example, your templates would be located at:
**http://yoursite.com/freeform_next_demo/**

If you encounter any issues trying to install the demo templates, it's likely that your database user does not have sufficient privileges or your server configuration does not allow some or all of the actions.
