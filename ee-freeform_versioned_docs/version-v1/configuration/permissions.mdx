# Permissions

Freeform includes member group Permission controls to allow or deny access to various pages and parts of the Freeform control panel. Simply visit the Freeform permissions page (**Freeform** > **Settings** > **Permissions**) to grant/edit/remove permissions to Freeform. Super Admins ALWAYS have full access.
