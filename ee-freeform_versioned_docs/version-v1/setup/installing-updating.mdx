## Updating Instructions

:::info
If you're switching from Freeform Classic to the new Freeform, please see the [Switching from Freeform Classic](./switching-from-classic.mdx) documentation to learn more about the differences, and then view the [Migration utility](./switching-from-classic.mdx) documentation to prepare your site for migration. Freeform can be used alongside classic Freeform/Freeform Pro (Freeform Classic) installations if you're wanting to try out and/or switch to Freeform.
:::

:::info
If you're upgrading from Freeform **Lite** to Freeform **Pro**, you can follow these same instructions below. There will be no **update** button/process as it is not required, though you may see the **Update** button if the version number is greater (e.g. Lite 1.5.3 to Pro 1.6.4).
:::

Freeform has its own **Update Service** built in, which means that every time there's an update available, an **Updates Available** nav item will show up in the Freeform add-on area of the EE control panel. You can then review the changelog there, or [view it here](./changelog.mdx).
