:::warning
Freeform Classic, Freeform 1.x and Freeform 2.x are no longer supported. Please update to Freeform 3.x and ExpressionEngine 7.x.
:::

:::info
On March 26, 2024, ExpressionEngine began validating licenses and renewals for _Freeform_ and _Calendar_. If you have an unassociated Solspace add-on license, log in to ExpressionEngine.com and associate it with your site. Any Solspace add-on licenses over a year old appear as "expired" in EE6+. Renewing is optional, but recommended. For licenses purchased on the old Solspace site, a new license is required to upgrade to EE7 and use the latest Freeform/Calendar. See [Licenses & Renewals Explained](#licenses-renewals-explained) for more information.

| Number of sites<br /><small>_Each Freeform license purchase allows for use on a single website. You can also use this license on development and staging versions of the same site. If you are using the [Multiple Site Manager (MSM)](https://docs.expressionengine.com/latest/msm/overview.html) feature to have multiple sites on the same ExpressionEngine (EE) install, you need to purchase an additional license for each additional MSM site. However, exceptions can be considered.

### Licenses & Renewals Explained

A new purchase of Freeform allows you to download updates and contact support for help for up to 1 year. After that, you have up to 1 year to purchase a discounted renewal to regain access to download updates and contact support for help. If a renewal is not purchased within 1 year of expiry (2+ years since initial purchase), you will no longer be able to purchase a discounted renewal and will need to repurchase a full-price license if you wish to regain access to download updates and contact support for help.

**No matter what the status of your license is, Freeform will continue to work on your site.**

## FAQ

### How many sites can I use my license on?

Each Freeform license purchase allows for use on a single website. You can also use this license on development and staging versions of the same site. If you are using the [Multiple Site Manager (MSM)](https://docs.expressionengine.com/latest/msm/overview.html) feature to have multiple sites on the same ExpressionEngine (EE) install, you need to purchase an additional license for each additional MSM site. However, exceptions can be considered. Please contact us to explain your situation, and we may grant additional licenses at no charge.

### What happens if I owned Freeform Lite or Express before?

If you purchased a copy of the Lite or Express editions on the [EE Add-ons Store](https://expressionengine.com/add-ons/freeform) in the past, your license has automatically been updated to a complete ("Pro") edition of Freeform. However, if you purchased a license from the _Solspace.com store_, these licenses are beyond the 2-year period and will require you to buy a new copy of Freeform 3 from the [EE Add-ons Store](https://expressionengine.com/add-ons/freeform).

### Is Freeform 3 a free upgrade?

If you purchased a copy of Freeform on the [EE Add-ons Store](https://expressionengine.com/add-ons/freeform) in the past, your license has automatically been updated to include Freeform 3. However, if you purchased a license from the _Solspace.com store_, these licenses are beyond the 2-year period and will require you to buy a new copy of Freeform 3 from the [EE Add-ons Store](https://expressionengine.com/add-ons/freeform).

### Do you offer discounts?

Unfortunately, we cannot provide discounts at this time as the [EE Add-ons Store](https://expressionengine.com/add-ons/freeform) does not allow for coupon codes, etc.

### Can I try before I buy?

We currently do not offer any trials, but we do have a 30 day satisfaction guarantee. If you're not satisfied, just contact us within 30 days of purchase for full refund.

### Can I switch from Classic?

Yes! The new Freeform includes a migration utility that allows you to migrate most of your Classic data over. See [documentation](./setup/switching-from-classic.mdx) for more information.
