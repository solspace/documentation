# Installing & Updating

## Requirements

Solspace Freeform Express, Lite and Pro editions all have mostly the same minimum requirements as listed on the [ExpressionEngine Requirements](https://docs.expressionengine.com/v6/installation/requirements.html) page:

- ExpressionEngine 6.x
- PHP 7
- [PHP iconv](http://php.net/manual/en/book.iconv.php) enabled
- MySQL 5.6 or newer
- Windows and macOS browsers:
  - Chrome 21 or newer
  - Firefox 28 or newer
  - Safari 9.0 or newer
  - Internet Explorer 11 or newer
  - Microsoft Edge

## Installing Instructions

1. Unzip the download package:
   - Select the EE version you're installing Freeform for (e.g. **EE6** for EE 6.x).
   - Within that EE version directory, copy the _freeform_next_ folder to your EE site's **./system/user/addons/** directory.
   - Within the **themes** folder of that EE version directory, copy the _freeform_next_ folder to your EE site's **./themes/user/** directory.
2. Go to the _Add-Ons_ page and find _Freeform_ in the list, and click **Install**.

## Updating Instructions

:::info
If you're switching from Freeform Classic to the new Freeform, please see the [Switching from Freeform Classic](../setup/switching-from-classic.mdx) documentation to learn more about the differences, and then view the [Migration utility](./classic-migration.mdx) documentation to prepare your site for migration. The migration is best run on Freeform 1.x for EE3-5.
:::

:::info
If you're upgrading from Freeform **Lite** to Freeform **Pro**, you can follow these same instructions below. There will be no **update** button/process as it is not required, though you may see the **Update** button if the version number is greater (e.g. Lite 2.0.3 to Pro 2.1.4).
:::

Freeform has its own **Update Service** built in, which means that every time there's an update available, an **Updates Available** nav item will show up in the Freeform add-on area of the EE control panel. You can then review the changelog there, or [view it here](./changelog.mdx).
