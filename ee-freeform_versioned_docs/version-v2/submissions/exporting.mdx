# Exporting

Freeform includes 3 options for exporting:

## Quick Export

Freeform's Quick Export feature displays inside the Submissions page of the Freeform control panel. Clicking the _Quick Export_ button at the top of the page allows you to export all submissions for a given form, in your choice of **CSV**, **Text**, **JSON** or **XML**. You can then exclude whichever fields you don't want exported.

## Export Profiles

Freeform's Export Profiles feature allows admins to create more complex pre-defined export profiles that can be run by any user with proper permissions at any time. Options for export profiles are as follows:

### Name

Create an intuitive name of the profile that is easy for your clients / administrators to figure out.

### Statuses

Select which statuses, if any, to filter the results by.

### Date Range

Select a date range, if any, you want the results limited by. Current options are:

- None
- Today
- Yesterday
- Last 7 days
- Last 30 days
- Last 365 days

### Limit

Maximum number of submissions the export should generate.

### Fields to Export

Select the fields you'd like to be included and rearrange their order.

### Filters

- Add filters to narrow down your results.
- Select a field name and check if it's **Equal to** / **Not equal to** / **Like** a value specified.
- Specify as many filters as you wish.

## Basic CSV Export

Freeform also includes basic CSV exporting functionality.

To export all of your Freeform submissions:

1. For the form you'd like to export, click on the submissions count in the **Submissions** column of the forms list.
2. At the top right of the page, click the **Export CSV button**.
   - Currently you can only export ALL submissions.
