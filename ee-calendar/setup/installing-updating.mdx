# Installing & Updating

## Requirements

Solspace Calendar has mostly the same minimum requirements as listed on the [ExpressionEngine Requirements](https://docs.expressionengine.com/v7/installation/requirements.html) page:

- ExpressionEngine 7.x
- PHP 8.0 - 8.4
- [PHP iconv](http://php.net/manual/en/book.iconv.php) enabled
- MySQL 5.6 or newer

:::danger
Calendar 5.x no longer supports PHP 7.4. If you require PHP 7.4 support, please use Calendar 4.x.
:::

## Installing Instructions

1. Unzip the download package:
   - Open the **EE7** folder.
   - Copy the `calendar` folder to your EE site's `./system/user/addons/` directory.
   - Within the `themes` folder, copy the `calendar` folder to your EE site's `./themes/user/` directory.
2. Go to the _Add-Ons_ page and find _Calendar_ in the list, and click **Install**.

:::info
If you had a previous non-Calendar flow setup where you used regular EE fields acting as Start/End Dates and Start/End Times and you're slowly transitioning from that to Calendar, please be sure that any of fields these are not named something like: `event_start_date`, `event_start_time`, `event_end_date`, `event_end_time`, etc. These are reserved names for Calendar's use, and will cause errors like `DateTime::__construct(): Failed to parse time string (0) at position 0 (0): Unexpected character` in your templates if you do not rename or remove the other fields.
:::

## Updating Instructions

Calendar has its own **Update Service** built in, which means that every time there's an update available, an **Updates Available** nav item will show up in the Calendar add-on area of the EE control panel. You can then review the changelog there, or [view it here](./changelog.mdx).
