# Calendar:Date template tag

`Calendar:Date` is a flexible utility tag that lets you generate and format date output for **any arbitrary date**, whether absolute or relative.

You'll typically use this tag in any of the following situations:

- You need fully formatted output for a specific date that isn't tied to an event.
- You want to calculate or display a date that is **relative to another date**.
- You need to convert date segments or variables into a **formattable date** inside a template (Calendar-related or otherwise).

The key advantage of `Calendar:Date` is its flexibility. Because it uses Calendar's powerful date parameters, you're not limited to fixed dates like **2026-04-15**—you can also output **relative dates** such as **2 weeks ago** or **next Friday.**

Even better, by using the [`base_date`](#base_date) parameter, relative dates don't have to be calculated from *today*. They can be calculated from **any date you choose**, giving you full control over how dates are derived and displayed.

```html
{exp:calendar:date}
```

## Parameters

### `base_date`
The base date for relative date calculations. Both [standard and easy-to-use text date formatting](../guides/date-formatting.mdx) apply to this parameter. Only relevant if the [output_date](#output_date) parameter is set to a relative value (ex: **1 week ago**). Default is equivalent to **today**. E.g. `base_date="2026-06-01"`.

### `output_date`
The date you want to display. Both [standard and easy-to-use text date formatting](../guides/date-formatting.mdx) apply to this parameter. If the value is a relative date, the date will be relative to the value of [base_date](#base_date). E.g. `output_date="2026-06-last"`.

### `output_format`
Controls formatting of the output date, formatted using [EE date formatting](https://docs.expressionengine.com/v7/templates/date-variable-formatting.html). If this parameter is not specified, the format defaults to `%Y%m%d` (e.g. `20260415`). E.g. `output_format="%Y-%m-%d"`.


## Examples

### Tomorrow
The following example is how you would generate **tomorrow**'s date:

```html
Weather forecast for Tomorrow -
{exp:calendar:date
  base_date="today"
  output_date="tomorrow"
  output_format="%F %j, %Y"
}
```

### 1 Year from Tomorrow
Or **1 year** from **tomorrow**'s date would be done like this:

```html
1 Year from Tomorrow would be
{exp:calendar:date
  base_date="tomorrow"
  output_date="1 year"
  output_format="%F %j, %Y"
}
```

### Convert Date Segments to Readable
If you've ever needed to turn date segments in the URL into a formattable date in your template, this is the perfect tag to use (Calendar related or not):

```html
{exp:calendar:date
  base_date="{segment_3}-{segment_4}-{segment_5}"
  output_date="today"
  output_format="%F %j, %Y"
}
```
