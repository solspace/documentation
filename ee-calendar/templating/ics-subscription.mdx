# Calendar:ICS_Subscription template tag

The `Calendar:ICS_Subscription` tag works similarly to [`Calendar:ICS_Export`](./ics-export.mdx), but instead of downloading a one-time file, it allows users to **subscribe** to your calendar using an ICS URL. This provides a **one-way sync**, keeping events in the user's calendar app automatically up to date.

ICS subscriptions are supported by most major calendar applications, including [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com), [Apple Calendar](https://support.apple.com/guide/calendar/welcome/mac), and [Microsoft Outlook](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/outlook/email-and-calendar-software-microsoft-outlook).

This tag outputs a **pre-formatted ICS feed**, so you only need to place it in a template, apply any desired parameters, and link to it. You can then share the resulting URL with users for subscription.

To enable ICS subscriptions, make sure **ICS Sharing** is turned on for the applicable calendar(s). This can be done from the Calendar control panel by clicking the green icon in the **Manage** column on the calendar list page. Once enabled, you may either:

- Use the `Calendar:ICS_Subscription` tag in a template, or
- Copy the ICS URL directly from the control panel and share it (privately or publicly).

:::info
All event dates in Calendar are stored and retrieved in `UTC+0`. This means an event entered at **6:00 PM** will always be stored as **6:00 PM**, regardless of location.

To ensure subscribed events display correctly across timezones, the `Calendar:ICS_Subscription` tag uses **floating time**, so events appear at the intended local time (for example, **6:00 PM**) no matter where the subscriber is located.

```html
{exp:calendar:ics_subscription}
```

## Parameters

### `hash`
This parameter is fed the unique hash value associated with the calendar to be subscribed to. It basically takes place of passing a calendar ID, with the added benefit of the site admin being able to revoke subscription access from users at any time. The hash value is available as a variable within the [Calendar:Calendars](../templating/calendars.mdx#calendarics_hash) tag. E.g. `hash="{segment_3}"`.

### `category`
This parameter allows you to export a specific set of events that belong to a category within a certain calendar by specifying a category ID. You can hardcode an category ID, pass it through an embed, or grab it from the URI. E.g. `category="{segment_4}"`.


## Examples

The following code is a complete example for handling the subscription of If you wish to export a single event or calendar, your code would look something more like this:

```html
{exp:calendar:ics_subscription
  hash="{segment_3}" {!-- Assuming linking like: site.com/calendar/ics-subscription/HASH --}
}
```
